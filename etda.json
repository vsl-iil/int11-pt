      "description": "(Palo Alto) On May 6 and May 11, 2015, Unit 42 observed two targeted attacks, the first against the U.S. government and the second on a European media company. Threat actors delivered the same document via spear-phishing emails to both organizations. The actors weaponized the delivery document to install a variant of the ‘'9002 RAT'’ Trojan called ‘3102’ that heavily relies on plugins to provide functionality needed by the actors to carry out on their objectives.\n\nThe 3102 payload used in this attack also appears to be related to the 'EvilGrab RAT' payload delivered in the watering hole attack hosted on the President of Myanmar’s website in May 2015.  Additionally, we uncovered ties between the C2 infrastructure and individuals in China active in online hacking forums that claim to work in Trojan development.",

Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, has seen it used in a single attack by a ransomware affiliate that attempted to deploy LockBit on a target’s network and then switched to 3AM when LockBit was blocked.\n\n3AM is written in Rust and appears to be a completely new malware family. The ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files. Once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete Volume Shadow (VSS) copies. It is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations.",

This use of additional payloads to enhance attack capabilities offers another example of efforts by threat actors to expand their target surfaces through the delivery of multiple payloads in a single campaign, in this case by including potential PoS terminals. This post will analyze AbaddonPOS; discuss the observed infection vectors; and expose, details on the downloader used to retrieve this new PoS malware. We will also provide evidence to demonstrate that the downloader malware and PoS malware are closely related, perhaps even written by the same actor or actors.",

The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the “free” version. This version of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar files within the docx and read the clear-text configuration file. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used, their use of Adzok is surprising. It is possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other RATs and that Adzok served a specific requirement.",

The defense against the attack was named ‘Operation Buckshot Yankee’. It led to the creation of the United States Cyber Command.\n\nIt started when a USB flash drive infected by a foreign intelligence agency was left in the parking lot of a Department of Defense facility at a base in the Middle East. It contained malicious code and was put into a USB port from a laptop computer that was attached to United States Central Command.",

The sample hash values were not changed frequently. Recently, TA505 used Amadey for their campaign in April 2019.",

This channel works independently of the operating system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall and network monitoring applications running on the host device. Until this incident, no malware had been discovered misusing the AMT SOL feature for communication.\n\nUpon discovery of this unique file-transfer tool, Microsoft shared information with Intel, and the two companies collaborated to analyze and better understand the purpose and implementation of the tool. We confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications.",

Upon launch, the malware creates a unique string with the format string template “%09d-%05d” based on random values, which is used as a unique identifier of the infected host. This malware collects process lists, excluding “[System Process]” and “System” processes and gets the exact OS version from the registry value at “HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion”. It seems that such values only exist from Windows 10, so we assume that the author developed and tested it on Windows 10.\n\nAt the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the “CheckUpdate” parameter. This file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor. But the devil is in the detail, as usual.\n\nThe code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path included in the updater and used as unique HTTP multipart message data separator string. Because of this, and the fact that the attacked platforms include Apple macOS, we decided to call this Operation AppleJeus.",

To use this malware, criminals need direct access to the target ATM, either over the network or physically (e.g. over USB). ATMii, if it is successful, allows criminals to dispense all the cash from the ATM.",

The AURIGA malware contains a driver component which is used to inject the malware DLL into other processes. This driver can also perform process and IP connection hiding. The malware family will create a copy of cmd.exe to perform its C2 activity, and replace the 'Microsoft corp' strings in the cmd.exe binary with different values. The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.",

The ransomware also deletes the volume shadow copies and other system backups and typically demands a ransom ranging between $150 and $900. Since the ransomware uses strong encryption algorithms like AES256 and RSA2048, no decryptor is available and it is impossible to decrypt the file without the key that was used to encrypt it. This ransomware is sold similar to other Ransomware-as-a-service(RaaS) like REvil. Thus, even someone with limited technical background can become an “affiliate” to spread the malware. In return, the profit gets shared between the threat actor and the affiliate. In this blog post we dissect this malware and discuss methods to perform threat hunting for the Avaddon ransomware family.",

Many comment leavers recommend it.\n\nAZORult is a Trojan stealer that collects various data on infected computers and sends it to the C&C server, including browser history, login credentials, cookies, files from folders as specified by the C&C server (for example, all TXT files from the Desktop folder), cryptowallet files, etc.; the malware can also be used as a loader to download other malware.

It exfiltrates system information to C2 server, maintains persistence on the system, and waits for further instruction from the operator.\n\n(Palo Alto) Based on our research, it appears the malware author calls the encoded secondary payload “Cowboy” regardless of what malware family is delivered.\n\nIn our analysis, we found BabyShark attacks were using 'KimJongRAT' and 'Gh0st RAT' as the encoded secondary payload and thus were the “Cowboys”.",

Discovered by the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT), this PoS malware targeted the US. Interestingly, we saw a clear decrease of hits during “dead hours” specifically at 2:00 AM, and an apparent recurring rise of hits at 10:00 AM. This trend follows regular business operation hours wherein PoS devices are more likely to be active and in use. Generally, the hits increase during business hours and decline during off-hours.",

Researchers from Gigamon analyzed the sample and found similarities with 'PunchBuggy', but Badhatch features new capabilities that allow it to scan for victim networks, provide attackers with remote access, install a backdoor, and deliver other modified malware payloads such as 'PoSlurp' and PunchBuggy, among other features.\n\nBadhatch begins infection much like its predecessor PowerSniff, by sending a customized phishing email via a weaponized Word document. Once the victim enables the macros, it executes PowerShells and shellcode scripts for PowerSniff, installing a backdoor in the process. Its network scan capability makes it different from PowerSniff; it is unable to check if the systems infected is in the education or healthcare sector. The researchers also noted that it lacks the sandbox detection and anti-virus analysis evasion features, as well as the long-term persistence tools that its predecessor had. However, they note that this also serves as an advantage as the attackers can execute the routine after infection and have greater control on how the malware can be used, thereby avoiding automated sandboxing features.",

The malware family contains functionality for keylogging, creating and killing processes, performing filesystem and registry modifications, spawning interactive command shells, performing process injection, logging off the current user or shutting down the local machine. In addition, the malware also implements a custom VNC like protocol which sends screenshots of the desktop to the C2 server and accepts keyboard and mouse input. The malware communicates to its C2 servers using SSL, with self signed SSL certificates. The malware family will create a copy of cmd.exe to perform its C2 activity, and replace the 'Microsoft corp' strings in the cmd.exe binary with different values. The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.",

The 'bazar' domain can only be utilized on Emercoin's DNS servers, and as it is decentralized, it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for law enforcement to seize the hostname.\n\nAfter the payload is downloaded, it will be filelessly injected into the C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe process. Security researcher Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer that this is done using the Process Hollowing and Process Doppelgänging techniques.\n\nAfter a period of time, both Kremez and James have told BleepingComputer that the backdoor will download and execute the 'Cobalt Strike' penetration testing and post-exploitation toolkit on the victim's machine.",

BHUNT is a modular stealer written in .NET, capable of exfiltrating wallet (Exodus, Electrum, Atomic, Jaxx, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin wallets) contents, passwords stored in the browser, and passphrases captured from the clipboard.",

      "description": "(Palo Alto) In early May, Unit 42 discovered an attack campaign against at least one defense company in Russia and one unidentified organization in South Korea delivering a variant of Bisonal malware. While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least 2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file’s contents.\n\nAttacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and FireEye revealed attacks using Bisonal against Japanese organizations. In October 2017, AhnLab published a report called “Operation Bitter Biscuit,” an attack campaign against South Korea, Japan, India and Russia using Bisonal and its successors, Bioazih and Dexbia. We believe it is likely these tools are being used by one group of attackers.",

      "description": "BlackEnergy, its first version shortened as BE1, started as a crimeware being sold in the Russian cyber underground as early as 2007. Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\n\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\n- download and execute a remote file;\n- execute a local file on the infected computer;\n- update the bot and its plugins;\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\n\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\n- operations with victim's filesystem\n- spreading with a parasitic infector\n- spying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\n- Team viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\n- listing Windows accounts and scanning network\n- destroying the system\n\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government. The power grid compromise has become known as the first-of-its-kind cyber warfare attack affecting civilians.",

In this blogpost we present the first public analysis of this UEFI bootkit, which is capable of running on even fully-up-to-date Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Functionality of the bootkit and its individual features leads us to believe that we are dealing with a bootkit known as BlackLotus, the UEFI bootkit being sold on hacking forums for $5,000 since at least October 2022.",

      "description": "(ThreatFabric) Around May 2020 ThreatFabric analysts have uncovered a new strain of banking malware dubbed BlackRock that looked pretty familiar. After investigation, it became clear that this newcomer is derived from the code of the Xerxes banking malware, which itself is a strain of the 'LokiBot' Android banking Trojan. The source code of the Xerxes malware was made public by its author around May 2019, which means that it is accessible to any threat actor.\n\nTechnical aspects aside, one of the interesting differentiators of BlackRock is its target list; it contains an important number of social, networking, communication and dating applications. So far, many of those applications haven't been observed in target lists for other existing banking Trojans. It therefore seems that the actors behind BlackRock are trying to abuse the grow in online socializing that increased rapidly in the last months due to the pandemic situation.\n\nBlackRock offers a quite common set of capabilities compared to average Android banking Trojans. It can perform the infamous overlay attacks, send, spam and steal SMS messages, lock the victim in the launcher activity (HOME screen of the device), steal and hide notifications, deflect usage of Antivirus software on the device and act as a keylogger. Interestingly, the Xerxes Trojan itself offers more features, but it seems that actors have removed some of them in order to only keep those that they consider useful to steal personal information.\n\nNote: This malware was initially named BlackRock and later renamed to AmpleBot.",

The front-end is built on electron and the back-end is a Neo4j database, the data leveraged is pulled from a series of data collectors also referred to as ingestors which come in PowerShell and C# flavours.\n\nIt can be used on engagements to identify different attack paths in Active Directory (AD), this encompasses access control lists (ACLs), users, groups, trust relationships and unique AD objects. The tool can be leveraged by both blue and red teams to find different paths to targets. The subsections below explain the different and how to properly utilize the different ingestors.",

The backdoor listens for incoming HTTP requests to the root URI / on the established port, parses the HTTP request, and executes the URL encoded data stored within the ‘kmd’ variable of the request via the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe). The output of this command is then sent back to the operator in the body of the HTTP response.

Manuscrypt is one of the Lazarus group’s tools that is actively being updated and used. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising this victim, Lazarus attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool, but failed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying various freeware and red-teaming tools used.\nAlthough Lazarus has recently tended to focus more on targeting the financial industry, we believe that in this campaign they were seeking to exfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread Bookcode using a decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector. Based on our observations, we evaluate that the Bookcode malware is being used exclusively for cyber-espionage campaigns.",

If the value matches the static hash, the executable will subject the command line argument to a second algorithm that will produce a value that the Trojan will use as the decryption key to decrypt the embedded FakeM shellcode. It essentially brute forces its own decryption key by rerunning itself over and over until it runs with the correct value is provided on the command line.

We discovered several versions of the malware being distributed, with differences between each version showing improvements and bug fixes (and sometimes creating new bugs). These updates, occurring within short intervals between samples, suggest a trial-and-error approach.\n\nBugSleep main logic is similar in all versions, starting with many calls to the Sleep API to evade sandboxes and then it loads the APIs it needs to run properly. It then creates a mutex (we observed “PackageManager” and “DocumentUpdater” in our samples) and decrypts its configuration which includes the C&C IP address and port. All the configurations and strings are encrypted in the same way, where every byte is subtracted with the same hardcoded value.\n\nIn most BugSleep samples, the malware then creates a scheduled task with the same name as the mutex and adds the comment 'sample comment' to it. The scheduled task, which ensures persistence for BugSleep, runs the malware and is triggered every 30 minutes on a daily basis.",

It implements the expected behavior of ransomware, discovering local drives and network shares and encrypting files found on these devices. It doesn’t require an internet connection to encrypt its victims’ files, since it doesn’t communicate with a server to send the encryption keys. Instead, it appends a “token” at the end of the ransom message and demands that the victims communicate with the operators via email or Bitmessage.\n\nTo encrypt as many important resources as possible, Filecoder.Buran starts a thread dedicated to killing key software that might have open handles on files containing valuable data, thus preventing them being encrypted. The targeted processes are mainly database management systems (DBMS). Furthermore, Filecoder.Buran removes log files and backups, to make it as difficult as possible for victims without any offline backups to recover their files.",

      "description": "(Pangu Lab) In a certain month of 2013, during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key domestic department, researchers from the Pangu Lab extracted a set of advanced backdoors on the Linux platform, which used advanced covert channel behavior based on TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding, and self-destruction design. In case of failure to fully decrypt, It is further found that this backdoor needs the check code bound to the host to run normally. Then the researchers cracked the check code and successfully ran the backdoor. Judging from some behavioral functions, this is a top-tier APT backdoor, but further investigation requires the attacker's asymmetric encrypted private key to activate the remote control function. Based on the most common string 'Bvp' in the sample and the numerical value 0x47 used in the encryption algorithm, the team named the corresponding malicious code 'Bvp47' at the time.",

Past observations of Derusbi in various attack campaigns indicate the version used was compiled specifically for that campaign.

Although our initial analysis didn’t show any novel or advanced techniques, we did observe strong persistence during the campaign that triggered our curiosity.\n\nWe followed network traces and pivoted on the information left behind by this actor, such as open directories, document metadata, and binary peculiarities, which enabled us to find a custom-made piece of malware, that we named “CapturaTela”. Our discovery of this malware family shows the reason for the persistent focus on hotel reservations as a primary vector: stealing credit card information from customers.",

This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak’s capabilities.\n\nCarbanak copies itself into “%system32%\\com” with the name “svchost.exe” with the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted.\n\nTo ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is “<ServiceName>Sys” where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the first character deleted. For example, if the existing service ́s name is “aspnet” and the visible name is “Asp.net state service”, the service created by the malware would be “aspnetSys” with a visible name of “Sp.net state service”.\n\nBefore creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the attackers adapt their tools to the victim ́s defenses.",

While not as sophisticated as HenBox, certain samples of CarbonSteal do make use of a combination of native libraries and DEX classes, while others do not and are much simpler.\n\nHallmarks of CarbonSteal include extensive audio recording functionality in a variety of codecs and audio formats, as well as the capability in later samples to control an infected device through specially crafted SMS messages. Attackers can also perform audio surveillance through the malware’s ability to silently answer a call from a specific phone number and allow the attacker to listen in to sounds around an infected device. Based on this functionality, we suspect that CarbonSteal might be deployed in areas with insufficient or no mobile data coverage.\n\nSamples of CarbonSteal and 'HenBox' also use the same non-compromised signing certificates in many cases, suggesting the actor behind their deployment is the same. Furthermore, overlapping validity dates of these certificates may indicate that the samples were produced around the same time frame. This evidence led Lookout researchers to the theory that these tools were primarily used in an ongoing malware campaign (at the time) and against similar targets, with titles and languages once again suggesting a Uyghur focused interest.",

In June 2019, we observed one of these overlapping domains, specifically, windows64x[.]com, being used as the C2 server for a new PowerShell based backdoor that we’ve named CASHY200. This PowerShell backdoor used DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server, specifically by issuing DNS A queries to the actor controlled name server at the aforementioned domain. CASHY200 parses data provided by the C2 server within DNS answers to run commands on the system and send the results back to the C2 via DNS queries. In several samples, CASHY200 used randomly generated identifiers that are stored in the registry at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Cashe\\index and used the command value 200 to communicate with the C2 server. These details are the basis for the name CASHY200.",

Once dropped onto your Android device, the malicious app looks like the icon seen in the screen below and is titled “System Application.”\n\nWorse still, this piece of malware can also go after your bank account login details. This malware has the ability to pose as over 2,200 banks and financial institutions. It does so by adopting the logo and mobile application name of a bank used in the Google Play Store, allowing the author to use simple templates to harvest username and password or credit card information. The overlay is HTML-based and not as sophisticated as other Android banking malware such as 'LokiBot', 'Red Alert', or 'ExoBot', but the power here is clearly in the shotgun approach: using simple phishing overlay screens, the criminals are able to target many more users, increasing their likelihood of financial gain.",

In contrast to PlugX and PIVY, which are used by multiple campaigns, ChChes appears to be unique to this group. An analysis of the malware family can be found later in this blog.\n\nInterestingly, the ChChes samples we observed were digitally signed using a certificate originally used by HackingTeam and later part of the data leaked when they were themselves hacked. Wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting Japan in November. It’s not clear why the attackers chose to use this certificate, as it was old, had been leaked online, and had already been revoked by the time they used it. Digital certificates are typically used because they afford an air of legitimacy, which this one definitely does not.",

The web shell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised Windows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390, but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels.\n\nIn our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web servers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have additional data about how the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as older versions of Oracle WebLogic or WordPress that may have been targeted with known remote code execution or file inclusion exploits.\n\nChina Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to connect to and generate server-side code that must be added to the targeted website code in order to communicate.\n\nThe server-side code is extremely simple and contains, depending on the application platform, just a single line of code. The backdoor supports .NET Active Server Pages or PHP.\n\nWe cannot be sure if the simplicity of the server code was a deliberate decision on the part of the China Chopper developers to make detection more difficult, but using pattern matching on such as short snippet may produce some false positive detections.\n\nThe China Chopper client communicates with affected servers using HTTP POST requests. The only function of the server-side code is to evaluate the request parameter specified during the configuration of the server code in the client GUI. In our example, the expected parameter name is 'test.' The communication over HTTP can be easily spotted in the network packet captures.\n\nChina Chopper contains a remote shell (Virtual Terminal) function that has a first suggested command of 'netstat an|find 'ESTABLISHED.'' and it is very likely that this command will be seen in process creation logs on affected systems.",

Banks in the UK, Spain, the US, Russia, Japan and Italy make up the majority of its potential targets.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect the new banking malware as Trojan-Banker.Win32.Chthonic.\n\nThe Trojan is apparently an evolution of 'ZeusVM', although it has undergone a number of significant changes. Chthonic uses the same encryptor as 'Andromeda' bots, the same encryption scheme as Zeus AES and Zeus V2 Trojans, and a virtual machine similar to that used in ZeusVM and 'KINS' malware.",

The malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks the first time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other than possible small-scale testing.\n\nThe CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as “BastionSolution” and “OneDriveSolution”) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is significantly different. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded C&C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service for communicating with its masters, making it significantly harder for defenders to notice the traffic and block the communication channel. What is most significant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the first days of July and the other starting from the 20th of the month. Details of the first wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke, was published by Palo Alto Networks on 14th July. This was followed by additional details from Kaspersky in a blog post published on 16th July.",

      "description": "(MIVD) The COATHANGER malware provides access to compromised FortiGate devices after installation. The implant connects back periodically to a Command & Control server over SSL, providing a BusyBox reverse shell.\nNotably, the COATHANGER implant is persistent, recovering after every reboot by injecting a backup of itself in the process responsible for rebooting the system.  Moreover, the infection survives firmware upgrades. Even fully patched FortiGate devices may therefore be infected, if they were compromised before the latest patch was applied.\nFurthermore, COATHANGER is stealthy: it is hard to detect using default FortiGate CLI commands, because it hides itself by hooking most system calls that could reveal its presence, such as stat and opendir. It does so by replacing them for any process that is forced to load preload.so.\nNote that COATHANGER is distinct from 'BOLDMOVE', another RAT targeting FortiGate devices.",

      "description": "Cobalt Strike is a paid penetration testing product that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named 'Beacon' on the victim machine. Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\n\nThe Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.",

We explained that a link exists between Uroburos and the 'Agent.BTZ' malware, which was responsible for 'the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever.' Nine months later, after the buzz around Uroburos, aka Snake or Turla, we now identified a new generation of Agent.BTZ. We dubbed it ComRAT and, by now, analyzed two versions of the threat (v3.25 and v3.26).",

This control introduces the novel ability of skipping the encryption of local files and only targeting networked SMB shares, including those from IP addresses specifically provided by the adversary. This is a very rare ability that’s previously been seen with the Sodinokibi ransomware family.\n\nAnother new technique, documented in very few ransomware families, is the use of the Windows Restart Manager to ensure that all files can be encrypted. Just as Windows will attempt to cleanly shut down open applications when the operating system is rebooted, the ransomware will utilize the same functionality to cleanly close the application that has a file locked. By doing so, the file is freed up for encryption.",

This component can be instructed by the C&C server to download and execute arbitrary modules, and it is these modules that provide CozyDuke with its vast array of functionality. Known CozyDuke modules include:\n• Command execution module for executing arbitrary Windows Command Prompt commands\n• Password stealer module\n• NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hash stealer module\n• System information gathering module\n• Screenshot module\n\nIn addition to modules, CozyDuke can also be instructed to download and execute other, independent executables. In some observed cases, these executables were self-extracting archive files containing common hacking tools, such as 'PsExec' and 'Mimikatz', combined with script files that execute these tools. In other cases, CozyDuke has been observed downloading and executing tools from other toolsets used by the Dukes such as 'OnionDuke', 'SeaDuke', and 'HammerDuke'.",

While similar threats have existed for years, this tactic did not become widespread until CryptoLocker's considerable success. Traditionally, ransomware disabled victims' access to their computers through non-destructive means until the victims paid for the computers' release.\n\nEarly CryptoWall variants closely mimicked both the behavior and appearance of the genuine CryptoLocker. The exact infection vector of these early infections is not known as of this publication, but anecdotal reports from victims suggest the malware arrived as an email attachment or drive-by download. Evidence collected by CTU researchers in the first several days of the February 2014 campaign showed at least several thousand global infections.",

Although the RAT was developed back in 2008, it began to proliferate at the start of 2012. The program was discontinued, partially due to its use in the Syrian civil war to monitor activists but also due to its author's fear of being arrested for unnamed reasons. As of August 2018, the program's development 'has ceased indefinitely', and downloads are no longer offered on its official website.\n\nDarkComet allows a user to control the system with a graphical user interface. It has many features which allows a user to use it as administrative remote help tool; however, DarkComet has many features which can be used maliciously. DarkComet is commonly used to spy on the victims by taking screen captures, key-logging, or password stealing.",

We have named this tool that generates these documents DealersChoice.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of this new tactic, we were able to identify two different variants of the embedded SWF files: the first being a standalone version containing a compressed payload which we have dubbed DealersChoice.A and a second variant being a much more modular version deploying additional anti-analysis techniques which we have dubbed DealersChoice.B. The unearthing of DealersChoice.B suggests a possible code evolution of the initial DealersChoice.A variant. Also, artifacts within DealersChoice suggests that Sofacy created it with the intentions to target both Windows and OSX operating systems, as DealersChoice could potentially be cross-platform due to its use of Adobe Flash files.",

The file, when XORed with 0x95, was an executable (MD5: 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701).\n\nUpon execution, 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 writes “28542CC0.dll” (MD5: 46fd936bada07819f61ec3790cb08e19) to this location:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll\n\nIn order to maintain persistence, the original malware adds this registry key:\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\28542CC0\nThe registry key has this value:\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll”,Launch\n\nThe malware (8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701) then connects to a host in South Korea (180.150.228.102). This callback traffic is HTTP over port 443 (which is typically used for HTTPS encrypted traffic; however, the traffic is not HTTPS nor SSL encrypted).",

The difference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain text requests to port 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. Oilrig added the publicly available DNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows DoH queries to Google and Cloudflare services. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVID-related domain which are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples.",

These techniques work together to significantly decrease the chances of detection by security defenses.\nUpon analyzing DodgeBox, we discovered significant resemblances to the well-known StealthVector loader used by APT41.

This app was the first publicly exposed sample of a malware family called DoubleAgent. When Lookout initially investigated DoubleAgent in 2015, it was already an advanced Android remote access tool (RAT). Early versions of this family trojanized apps such as Voxer and TalkBox, as well as Amaq News, the official Daesh news application. The extent of this malware family and its connections to other campaigns has not been publicly reported on until now. Lookout researchers have seen DoubleAgent used exclusively against groups with contentious relationships with the Chinese government.\n\nAlthough Lookout has been tracking this malware family for many years, new samples discovered in the last year indicated that the actors behind DoubleAgent were continuing to evolve the surveillanceware and use new infrastructure. However, they maintained the same targeting, as well as several key malware characteristics, such as similar decryption keys for configuration files.\n\nThese recent samples, discovered in late 2019, are the focus of this section on DoubleAgent. A decryption of the configuration files from these samples revealed a direct overlap in C2 infrastructure between the operators of DoubleAgent and 'SilkBean' at a time when both malware families appeared to be active.",

These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.'\nAccording to MalwareBytes, 'Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.'\nIBM X-Force discovered 'a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the 'atom tables' that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.'",

Decryption relies on the target machine's HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGUID, thereby keying the launcher to the victim system. The decrypted PE from the launcher is a memory-only dropper (Stage 2) that is responsible for decrypting an embedded configuration and two or more embedded plugin dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) from its .lrsrc section. Once executed, these DLLs begin the setup of the modular plugin system. The first observed plugin (Stage 3) is responsible for low-level network setup and encryption. The second observed plugin (Stage 4) is responsible for higher-level network operations and may function as a downloader for additional plugins that, when loaded, may register themselves with prior components in the execution chain for additional functionality. We've observed the second plugin to vary in functionality and more plugin variants likely exist.",

      "description": "(SecureWorks) In early June 2014, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team discovered the Dyre banking trojan, which was being distributed by 'Cutwail' botnet spam emails that included links to either Dropbox or Cubby file storage services. The threat actors later shifted to distribution via the 'Upatre' downloader trojan. Dyre is also known as Dyreza, Dyzap, and Dyranges by the antivirus industry.\n\nDyre harvests credentials, primarily targeting online banking websites to perform Automated Clearing House (ACH) and wire fraud. The malware includes a modular architecture, man-in-the-browser functionality, and a backconnect server that allows threat actors to connect to a bank website through the victim's computer. The man-in-the-browser functionality is based on a unique combination of redirects to fake websites controlled by the threat actor ('web fakes') and a dynamic web inject system that allows the threat actors to manipulate a financial institution's website content. Similar to other banking trojans, Dyre hooks into the most popular web browsers to intercept traffic from a victim's system, stealing information and manipulating website content before it is rendered by the browser.\n\nEarly Dyre versions were relatively primitive, sending command and control (C2) communications and stolen data via unencrypted HTTP. Recent iterations of Dyre use SSL to encrypt all C2 communications, as well as a custom encryption algorithm. Dyre also uses RSA cryptography to digitally sign configuration files and malware plugins to prevent tampering.",

While relatively straightforward as a ransomware sample in terms of encrypting files and displaying a ransom note, EKANS featured additional functionality to forcibly stop a number of processes, including multiple items related to ICS operations. While all indications at present show a relatively primitive attack mechanism on control system networks, the specificity of processes listed in a static “kill list” shows a level of intentionality previously absent from ransomware targeting the industrial space. ICS asset owners and operators are therefore strongly encouraged to review their attack surface and determine mechanisms to deliver and distribute disruptive malware, such as ransomware, with ICS-specific characteristics.",

Both Emissary and Elise are part of a malware group referred to as “LStudio”, which is based on the following debug strings found in Emissary and Elise samples.\n\nThere is code overlap between Emissary and Elise, specifically in the use of a common function to log debug messages to a file and a custom algorithm to decrypt the configuration file. The custom algorithm used by Emissary and Elise to decrypt their configurations use the “srand” function to set a seed value for the “rand” function, which the algorithm uses to generate a key. While the “rand” function is meant to generate random numbers, the malware author uses the “srand” function to seed the “rand” function with a static value. The static seed value causes the “rand” function to create the same values each time it is called and results in a static key to decrypt the configuration. The seed value is where the Emissary and Elise differ in their use of this algorithm, as Emissary uses a seed value of 1024 and Elise uses the seed value of 2012.\n\nWhile these two Trojans share code, we consider Emissary and Elise separate tools since their configuration structure, command handler and C2 communications channel differ. The Emissary Trojan delivered in this attack contains the components listed in Table 1. At a high level, Emissary has an initial loader DLL that extracts a configuration file and a second DLL containing Emissary’s functional code that it injects into Internet Explorer.",

The infection may arrive either via malicious script, macro-enabled document files, or malicious link. Emotet emails may contain familiar branding designed to look like a legitimate email. Emotet may try to persuade users to click the malicious files by using tempting language about “Your Invoice,” “Payment Details,” or possibly an upcoming shipment from well-known parcel companies.\n\nEmotet has gone through a few iterations. Early versions arrived as a malicious JavaScript file. Later versions evolved to use macro-enabled documents to retrieve the virus payload from command and control (C&C) servers run by the attackers.\n\nEmotet uses a number of tricks to try and prevent detection and analysis. Notably, Emotet knows if it’s running inside a virtual machine (VM) and will lay dormant if it detects a sandbox environment, which is a tool cybersecurity researchers use to observe malware within a safe, controlled space.\n\nEmotet also uses C&C servers to receive updates. This works in the same way as the operating system updates on your PC and can happen seamlessly and without any outward signs. This allows the attackers to install updated versions of the software, install additional malware such as other banking Trojans, or to act as a dumping ground for stolen information such as financial credentials, usernames and passwords, and email addresses.",

It takes advantage of CVE-2017-0145, which has been patched with the MS17-010 security bulletin. One might note that file sharing over SMB is normally used only within local networks and that the SMB ports are typically blocked from the internet at the firewall. However, if an attacker has access to a vulnerable endpoint running SMB, the ability to run arbitrary code in kernel context from a remote location is a serious compromise.\n\nThis exploit was written to remotely install and launch an SMB backdoor. At the core of this exploit is a type confusion vulnerability leading to an attacker offset controlled arbitrary heap write. As with almost any heap corruption exploit, the attacker must know or control the layout of the heap to consistently succeed. With SMB, most objects are allocated in the non-paged pool.",

RIPTIDE’s first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key, and the RC4 encryption key is used to encrypt all further communication.\n\nIn June 2014, Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth. The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014.\n\nFollowing the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE’s protocols and strings. We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in order to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors. The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules. FireEye dubbed this new malware family HIGHTIDE.",

While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files on the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the Filerase malware, recovery becomes impossible.\n\nFilerase is spread across the victim’s network from one initial computer using a list of remote computers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the attackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the intrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another tool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the computers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected machines.",

Due to it’s code name in the binary, we dubbed it FiXS.\n\nIt is not clear yet what the vector for the initial infection is. However, since FiXS utilizes an external keyboard (similar to Ploutus), we anticipate that it follows a similar methodology. In the case of Ploutus, a person with access to these teller machines physically connects an external keyboard to to the ATM for the attack to commence.\n\nSo far, we have identified some key relevant characteristics of FiXS malware:\n• It instructs the ATM to dispense money 30 minutes after the last ATM reboot\n• It is hidden inside another not-malicious-looking program\n• It is vendor-agnostic targeting any ATM that supports CEN XFS\n• It interacts with the crooks via external keyboard\n• It waits for the Cassettes to be loaded to start dispensing\n• It contains Russian metadata",

The program is being used for targeted cyber espionage in Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIts discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The last of these stated in its report that Flame 'is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.' Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN). It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers.",

It is a very large program and makes extensive use of object-oriented and multithreaded programming techniques. This makes reverse engineering and debugging the malware both difficult and time consuming. The coding style and techniques suggest that FlawedGrace was not written by the same developer as 'ServHelper'.\n\nFlawedGrace uses a complicated binary protocol for its command and control. It can use a configurable port for communications, but all samples we have observed to date have used port 443. Figure 8 shows an example of the first four messages between an infected system and C&C server.\n\nFlawedGrace also uses a series of commands, provided below for reference:\n• target_remove\n• target_update\n• target_reboot\n• target_module_load\n• target_module_load_external\n• target_module_unload\n• target_download\n• target_upload\n• target_rdp\n• target_passwords\n• target_servers\n• target_script\n• destroy_os\n• desktop_stat",

Centralized C2 servers are routinely tracked and blocked by the security community. GOZ, however, utilizes a P2P network of infected hosts to communicate and distribute data, and employs encryption to evade detection.

GandCrab variants caused a great deal of damage worldwide, including in South Korea.\n\nThe GandCrab ransomware shares an interesting history with AhnLab. Like many other examples of ransomware, GandCrab searches for any running or pre-installed anti‑malware program and when it finds one it interferes with its normal execution and shuts it down. However, when it came to AhnLab, GandCrab went the extra mile, specifically targeting the company and its anti-malware program V3 Lite by mentioning it in its code. It even revealed a vulnerability in the security program and made attempts to delete it entirely.\n\nTo effectively respond to and protect against GandCrab attacks, the AhnLab Security Analysis Team analysed GandCrab and all its different versions by thoroughly investigating the distributed code, encryption method, restoration method, and the evasive method it used to avoid behaviour-based detection. Each time a new attack feature targeting AhnLab and V3 was identified, the company’s product developers promptly addressed it to ensure maximum security.\n\nThe interesting conflict between AhnLab and the GandCrab ransomware was widely discussed in the IT security industry. However, the details that were revealed at the time were only the tip of the iceberg, with more details being kept private for reasons of confidentiality.",

Again, it uses the same packer that TA505 has been using.\n\nThe unpacked payload is written in C++ and basically works as a downloader for another malware. What makes Gelup different, however, is its obfuscation technique and UAC-bypassing function bymocking trusted directories (spoofing the file’s execution path in a trusted directory), abusing auto-elevated executables, and using the dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading technique.\n\nFirst, Gelup resolves most Windows application programming interfaces (APIs) by using the hash just before calling it —a common technique used by a lot of malware families. Second, the strings in Gelup’s code are decrypted at runtime.",

The attackers can send commands to a compromised web server by disguising them as web access requests. IIS logs them as normal but Trojan.Geppei can read them as commands.\nThe commands read by Geppei contain malicious encoded .ashx files.

      "description": "Currently, we identify this malware family as “Ghambar,” due to the word being used in some function names and variables inside the same malware’s code; also subsequent samples expose potentially personally identifiable information and alternative names. While Ghambar does not seem to share any significant codebase with past tools, we believe that Ghambar might be the successor of 'TinyZBot', which is one of the artifacts described by Cylance in the Operation Cleaver report. Similar to TinyZBot, Ghambar is also developed in C# and it employs the same SOAP­based command and control protocol. While it is provided with fewer features, Ghambar appears better designed and with a cleaner code style.\n\nInterestingly, Ghambar is designed to leave as little footprint on the system as possible. When collecting screenshots, clipboard data, and intercepted keystrokes, it attempts to directly send the data to the C&C without writing on disk.\n\nWhile executing a parallel keylogger, Ghambar is also able to receive instructions from the C&C on additional tasks to execute. These tasks can be additional plugins to be downloaded and executed, generic tasks on the file system, or a number of predefined commands.\n\nGhambar is provided with a full­featured plugins system. If instructed to do so by the C&C, the malware is able to download, store, and execute any given plugin.\n\nOther than generally creating, deleting and fetching files, Ghambar is also able to executed a number of predefined commands if instructed to do so by the C&C. The commands, identified by a command­type identifier, include the following:\n• Self­destruct;\n• Execute a command through 'cmd.exe' and return output;\n• Take a screenshot;\n• Shutdown the computer;\n• Restart the computer;\n• Logoff the user;\n• Lock the computer;\n• Turn on and off the monitor;\n• Set and copy clipboard data;\n• Enable or disable mouse/keyboard (although these procedures are not yet implemented);\n• “Enable or disable desktop” (not implemented);\n• Trigger a BSOD (also, not implemented).\n\nWhile the sample we obtained might be an earlier stage still under development, Ghambar is alreadyprovided with enough features to make it a fully­functional backdoor.",

We now believe this implant is the second-stage payload in the Olympics attack that ATR discovered January 6, 2018. The PowerShell implant used in the Olympics campaign was a stager based on the PowerShell Empire framework that created an encrypted channel to the attacker’s server. However, this implant required additional modules to be executed to be a fully capable backdoor. In addition, the PowerShell implant did not contain a mechanism to persist beyond a simple scheduled task. Gold Dragon has a much more robust persistence mechanism than the initial PowerShell implant and enables the attacker to do much more to the target system. Gold Dragon reappeared the same day that the Olympics campaign began.",

GoldenEagle code has been identified in an impressively large and diverse set of applications over the years. These samples can be divided into two major groups: those that exfiltrate data via HTTP and those that exfiltrate data via SMTP, i.e., by sending exfiltrated data in file attachments of emails to an attacker-controlled mailbox using innocuous-looking subjects and mail body content. The latter technique, while appearing in the early stages of GoldenEagle development, has resurfaced in samples signed and analysed in May 2020.",

BKDR_GORYNYCH may not technically be considered a PoS malware, as it is not entirely designed for PoS systems and is also being used outside of the Black Atlas operation. However, cybercriminals running Black Atlas have built a copy that can specifically look for the output file of the 'BlackPOS' malware, which is the one that harvested the credit card data from the targets in the first place. The fact that the images in Gorynych’s control panel were named “Kartoxa,” which also refers to BlackPoS, further proves the link between the two malware and the operation.\n\nAside from the PoS plugin, other modules usually downloaded from a subdirectory in the C&C server make up this malware’s entirety. These include plugins for getting screenshots, passwords, mails, and more. Without the plugins, Gorynych routines mostly focus on anti-analysis, information theft, and installations. In the Diamond Fox builder, the keylogger and PoS grabber functionalities are disabled by default. However, with Operation Black Atlas, these options were turned on, which proves that cybercriminals running this are intentionally targeting PoS systems.\n\nAfter downloading its plugins, Gorynych reports to its server via gate.php using HTTP POST. It uses its own user-agent that can be found in its configuration file. The parameters consist of system information used to profile the bot, mainly for identification in the Gorynych control panel. The posted information is encrypted using a simple XOR operation.",

This led to two main branches: one became known as 'Gozi v2', which was merged with Pony and became 'Vawtrak'/Neverquest.\n\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\n\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: 'IAP'. The panel's login page comes with the title 'Login - IAP'. The body contains 'AUTHORIZATION', 'Name:', 'Password:' and a single button 'Sign in' in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the ''DreamBot'' gate.\n\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\n\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and 'Nymaim' was detected. This breed became known as 'GozNym'. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run. The C2 communication is performed by Nymaim.",

From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers. The end result is a new banking Trojan in the wild.\n\nInternally, GozNym works like a double-headed beast, where the two codes rely on one another to carry out the malware’s internal operations.",

Interestingly, while most Blue Lambert variants have version numbers in the range of 2.x, Green Lambert is mostly in 3.x versions. This stands in opposition to the data gathered from export timestamps and C&C domain activity that points to Green Lambert being considerably older than the Blue variant. Perhaps both Blue and Green Lamberts have been developed in parallel by two different teams working under the same umbrella, as normal software version iterations, with one seeing earlier deployment than the other.\n\nSignatures created for Green Lambert (Windows) have also triggered on an OS X variant of Green Lambert, with a very low version number: 1.2.0. This was uploaded to a multiscanner service in September 2014. The OS X variant of Green Lambert is in many regards functionally identical to the Windows version, however it misses certain functionality such as running plugins directly in memory.",

According to our research, the GreyEnergy actors deploy this backdoor mainly on two types of endpoints: servers with high uptime, and workstations used to control ICS environments.\n\nTo make communication with command and control (C&C) servers stealthier, the malicious actors may deploy additional software on internal servers in the compromised network, so each server would act as a proxy. Such a proxy C&C redirects requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server on the internet. This way, it might be less suspicious to a defender who notices that multiple computers are “talking” to an internal server, rather than to a remote server. This technique can be also used by attackers to control the malware in different segments of a compromised network. A similar technique using internal servers as C&C proxies was used by the Duqu 2.0 APT.\n\nIf an affected organization has public-facing web servers connected to an internal network, the attackers may deploy “backup” backdoors onto these servers. These backdoors are used to regain access to the network in the event that the main backdoors are detected and removed.",

GuLoader is a downloader, written partly in VB6, which typically stores its encrypted payloads on Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive (underscoring that threat actors continue to adopt the cloud just like legitimate businesses are).\n\nGuLoader is a portable executable (PE) file that is often observed embedded in a container file such as an .iso or .rar file. We have also observed it being downloaded directly from various cloud hosting platforms. GuLoader is used predominantly to download remote access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers such as 'Agent Tesla'/Origin Logger, 'Formbook', 'NanoCore RAT', 'NetWire RC', 'RemcosRAT', 'Ave Maria'/Warzone RAT and Parallax RAT.",

However, based on intrusion data from incident response engagements, the operators tailor their tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and run a more “hands on keyboard” operation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts.\n\nIn addition, we identified similarities in the Hades ransom notes to those that have been used by REvil ransomware operators, where portions of the ransom notes observed contain identical wording.

Specifically, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke’s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on 'CozyDuke' victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them.\n\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image files that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute.\n\nHammerDuke’s use of Twitter and crafted image files is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both 'OnionDuke' and 'MiniDuke' also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image files contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions.",

Subsequently, it quietly installs necessary tools, such as xfsprogs, wipe, and parted, which are pivotal for later tasks involving disk partition manipulation and the secure erasure of data.\n\nLike its Windows variant, this wiper version transmits data to the same Telegram channel. The shared information aligns with what’s sent by the Windows variant but adds specific details, such as the system directory’s drive letter and prepared information on disk space.

Once files are deleted, and directories are left empty, it uses an incorrectly spelled method, DeleteDrirectorys, to remove these now-obsolete directories.\n\nDuring its operation, the wiper sends periodic updates to a predetermined Telegram chat, likely to inform its controllers about the ongoing progress or notify them when the task is completed. The dispatched information comprises the external IP address of the infected computer, the hostname, a timestamp, and a count of “Undeleted files” within critical file system locations such as the Windows directory and Program Files directories. This count is formatted to show the number of files that the malware has not managed to delete up to that point. This communication strategy serves as a means of real-time reporting on malicious activities, offering the attackers updates and insights into the efficacy of their attack.",

Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\n\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\n\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems. However, the data collected by Havex would have aided efforts to design and develop attacks against specific targets or industries.",

This malware was found around the same time the 'HermeticWiper' was found, and based on publicly available information from security community it was used in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. The new ransomware was likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its non-sophisticated style and poor implementation.",

The developers are using a tried and tested technique of wiper malware, abusing a benign partition management driver, in order to carry out the more damaging components of their attacks. Both the Lazarus Group ('Destover') and APT33 ('DistTrack') took advantage of Eldos 'RawDisk' in order to get direct userland access to the filesystem without calling Windows APIs.

The second generation of Hikit (referred to as “Gen 2”) uses the more traditional client model and beacons out to an attacker’s C2 server. While the communication models shifted dramatically between Gen 1 and Gen 2, both generations of Hikit retain the same basic RAT function consisting of remote command shell, file management, network proxy and port forwarding.",

Our analysis of the two campaigns revealed that Sakabota is the predecessor to Hisoka, which was first observed in May 2019.\n\nDuring our analysis, we identified two different versions of Hisoka, specifically v0.8 and v0.9, both installed onto the network of two Kuwait organizations. Both versions contain command sets that allow the actor to control a compromised system. In both versions, the actor can communicate via a command and control (C2) channel that uses either HTTP or DNS tunneling. However, v0.9 also added the ability for an email-based C2 channel as well.\n\nThe email-based C2 communications capability added to Hisoka v0.9 relies on Exchange Web Services (EWS) to use a legitimate account on an Exchange server in order to allow the actor to communicate with Hisoka. The malware attempts to log into an Exchange server using supplied credentials and uses EWS to send and receive emails in order to establish communications between the target and the actor. However, the communications channel does not actually send and receive emails like other email-based C2 channels we have seen in the past. Instead, the channel relies on creating email drafts that the Hisoka malware and the actor will process in order to exchange data back and forth. By using email drafts as well as the same legitimate Exchange account to communicate, no emails will be detected outbound or received inbound.\n\nWithin two hours of gaining access to the system through Hisoka, the actor deployed two additional tools named 'Gon' and 'EYE', whose names were based on the filenames Gon.sys and EYE.exe.",

Consisting of only 4 functions, HotelAlfa is an extremely simple piece of code and is clearly created for a limited purpose.\n\nFor each incoming connection, HotelAlfa spins off a new thread to handle the request. The thread reads up to 4096 bytes from the client and scans the response for specific keywords. The request from the client does not necessarily need to conform or comply with the HTTP request standard. Instead, the request merely must contain the appropriate file extension otherwise the default HTML page is returned. HotelAlfa responds to .wav and .j p g file extensions with the appropriate file.\n\nHotelAlfa only supplies three files to the client: an HTML page, a WAV sound file, and a JPG image. These files are stored within the HotelAlfa binary’s resource section under the RC_DATA branch. Each file is encoded with XOR 0x63, requiring HotelAlfa to decode each file prior to transmitting the data back to the requesting client. When HotelAlfa sends a response back to the client, the response does conform to the HTTP 1.1 standard.",

Any incoming requests for the specified URLs are picked up by the implant, which then proceeds to decode the data accompanying the HTTP request. The decoded HTTP data is, in fact, shellcode that is then executed on the infected endpoint.\n\nHTTPSnoop consists of the same code across all observed variants, with the key difference in samples being the URL patterns that it listens for.",

The Information Gathering Tool (IGT) tool is coded in Delphi and includes powershell and SQL components across a dozen different drops. This tool contains several other executable files made in different programming languages ranging from Visual Basic 6 to C#, each one performing a very clear task devised by the group when trying to obtain more information from an objective. The main purpose of the IGT tool is to make an inventory of the system, saving information from the network interfaces and addresses, credentials belonging to the Domain and database server, services being run from the OS and everything that could help the Poseidon Group make its attack more customized to its victim.",

To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).\n\nThese switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches; technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well. Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning of vital services.\n\nIndustroyer’s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the attackers didn’t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach the malware “to speak” those protocols.",

A number of bugs (some of which I've mentioned in this blog post) show a lack of sophistication and, possibly, a rush on the author's part. There are a number of artifacts that link this malware family to others we've seen. The blacklist of process names is extremely similar to the ones discovered in the 'Alina POS' malware family. Additionally, the installation path very much reminds me of the early 'Dexter' variants. It's certainly likely that because these malware families' code has been leaked online, the author used at least some of this code as a basis for JackPOS. While the malware technically has a command and control (C&C) component to it, overall it's quite limited and not nearly as robust as other examples seen in the past. I mentioned originally that I wanted to see if JackPOS brought something special to the table. I'm going to have to answer that question with a resounding 'no' in this particular case. However, while this family does not bring any innovative characteristics to the POS malware scene, as history has taught us, it should still very much be considered a real threat.",

JRat has been continuously developed for the last four years, seemingly by a single developer who goes by the name “redp0ison”. While JRat itself is closed source, many modules and helpful utilities are open source and are available on github.",

While detailed targeting information is not currently available, we believe Komplex has been used in attacks on individuals related to the aerospace industry, as well as attacks leveraging an exploit in MacKeeper to deliver the Trojan. The Komplex Trojan revealed a design similar to Sofacy’s 'JHUHUGIT' variant Trojan, which we believe may have been done in order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative ease.",

Similar to 2009, a number of government and private websites were targeted, this time using a tool called Trojan.Koredos. This attack was unusual for a DDoS attack because it did not use a command and control (C&C) server; the commands were hidden inside the threat itself. The use of a tactic like this indicated a growth in sophistication from the group compared to the 2009 attacks. Symantec research into this threat also found that, as well as carrying out a DDoS attack, if the infected computers were not cleared of this Trojan the master boot record (MBR) of some of them would be destroyed within 10 days.",

Group-IB researchers discovered that this malware, which was first registered on Virustotal in 2021, has almost exclusively been used against organizations in Thailand. At the time of writing, Group-IB researchers can confirm that Krasue was used against telecommunications companies, although it has likely been leveraged in attacks against organizations in other verticals as well.\n\nOwing to the fact that Thai companies were exclusively targeted, Group-IB has decided to call this RAT Krasue, a nod to the Thai name of a nocturnal native spirit known throughout Southeast Asian folklore. Krasue, who is said to hover in the air above the ground and is driven by extreme hunger, poses a severe risk to critical systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant attackers remote access to the targeted network. The malware also features rootkits embedded in the binary.",

When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name—for example: ‘executes terminal command’, ‘connect to remote system’, ‘send & retrieve file’, ‘create socket connection’.",

LoLBins are used by different actors combined with fileless malware and legitimate cloud services to improve chances of staying undetected within an organisation, usually during post-exploitation attack phases.\n\nLiving-off-the-land tactics mean that attackers are using pre-installed tools to carry out their work. This makes it more difficult for defenders to detect attacks and researchers to identify the attackers behind the campaign. In the attacks we're seeing, there are binaries supplied by the victim's operating system that are normally used for legitimate purposes, but in these cases, are being abused by the attackers.\n\n(LOLBAS Project) The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.\n\nA LOLBin/Lib/Script must:\n\n• Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.\n• Have extra 'unexpected' functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases.\no Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses\n• Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team\n\nInteresting functionality can include:\n\n• Executing code\no Arbitrary code execution\no Pass-through execution of other programs (unsigned) or scripts (via a LOLBin)\n• Compiling code\n• File operations\no Downloading\no Upload\no Copy\n• Persistence\no Pass-through persistence utilizing existing LOLBin\no Persistence (e.g. hide data in ADS, execute at logon)\n• UAC bypass\n• Credential theft\n• Dumping process memory\n• Surveillance (e.g. keylogger, network trace)\n• Log evasion/modification\n• DLL side-loading/hijacking without being relocated elsewhere in the filesystem.",

      "description": "(Fortinet) The binary for this particular variant of LockerGoga does not utilize any type of security evasion or obfuscation. Instead, the binary only goes as far as encoding the RSA public key that is used in its later stages for file encryption. It’s possible to speculate that the attackers may have already been fully aware of the target companies’ security measures, and were therefore confident that their malware would not be intercepted even without any obfuscation.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the malware uses open-source Boost libraries for its filesystem, and inter-process communication and Crypto++ (Cryptopp) for file encryption. One of the advantages of using these libraries is easier development and implementation since developers only need to work with wrapper functions instead of calling individual native APIs to achieve the same goal. And since this utilizes a higher level of programming, statically and dynamically analysing the application without source code is more complicated than just reading a straight sequence of Windows APIs. However, since they do not use standard libraries, they need to be manually linked and the functions need to be physically added to the final binary, which results a larger file size than usual.",

Our product is ideal for business owners, educational institutions, and Windows system administrators.'\n\nAnalysis upon install, however, reveals a very aggressive key logger that injects its code in almost every running process on the computer, and multiple attempts are made if not initially successful. This 'injection' behavior is aggressive even by the standard of the 'Zeus' family: very few malware families exhibit such an aggressive behavior, and it is particularly unusual to observe this in key loggers, even commercial ones. We have observed LuminosityLink being used to download additional payloads. It is possible that the actors involved here are using LuminosityLink as a platform to collect information from the victim, and using that information to decide whether to deploy more sophisticated malware at high-value targets.",

It schedules execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.\nRegarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude coordinates to build a Google Maps URL.\nThe GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server. The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name, username and password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.",

This method is used to avoid security tools that might not run when the computer starts in safe mode.\n\nMedusaLocker avoids encrypting executable files, most likely to avoid rendering the targeted system unusable for paying the ransom. To make it even more dangerous, MedusaLocker uses a combination of AES and RSA-2048, making the procedure of brute forcing the encryption practically impossible.",

      "description": "(Kaspersky) If a Microsoft Office vulnerability is successfully exploited, the exploit creates an executable PE file on the hard drive and launches it for execution. The malicious program is a platform used to deploy extra (add-on) malicious modules, store them stealthily and thus add new capabilities for the threat actors. The attack unfolds in several stages, as described below:\n\n1. The exploit is activated, and an appropriate (32-bit or 64-bit) version of the malicious program is installed on the victim computer, depending on the type of operating system installed on it. To do this installation, malicious code is injected into the system process ‘explorer.exe’ rather than into its memory. The malicious program has a modular structure: its main body is stored in the registry, while its add-on modules are downloaded following the instruction arriving from the C&C server. DLL hijacking (use of a modified system library) is used to ensure that the main module is launched each time the system is rebooted.\n2. The main module of the malicious program receives an instruction to download and launch add-on modules, which opens new capabilities for the threat actors.\n3. The malicious add-on modules provide opportunities to control the victim system, take screenshots of windows and intercept information entered from the keyboard. We have seen them in other cyber-espionage campaigns as well.\n4. The threat actors use PowerSploit, a modified set of PowerShell scripts, and various utilities to steal files and passwords found on the victim computer.\n\nThe cybercriminals were primarily interested in .doc, .ppt, .xls, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .txt and .rtf files on the victim computers. The harvested files were packed into a password-protected archive and sent to the threat actors’ server.\n\nOverall, the tactics, techniques and procedures that the cybercriminals used in their attacks can hardly be considered complicated or expensive. However, there were a few things that caught our eye:\n\n• The payload (at least one of the modules) is delivered using some simple steganography. Within traffic, it looks like a download of a regular JPEG image; however, the encrypted payload is loaded immediately after the image data. Microcin searches for a special ‘ABCD’ label in such a file; it is followed by a special structure, after which the payload comes, to be decrypted by Microcin. This way, new, platform-independent code and/or PE files can be delivered.\n• If the Microcin installer detects the processes of some anti-malware programs running in the system, then, during installation, it skips the step of injecting into ‘explorer.exe’, and the modified system library used for establishing the malicious program within the system is placed into the folder %WINDIR%; to do this, the system app ‘wusa.exe’ is used with the parameter “/extract” (on operating systems with UAC).",

      "description": "(FireEye) MINEBRIDGE is a 32-bit C++ backdoor designed to be loaded by an older, unpatched instance of the legitimate remote desktop software 'TeamViewer' by DLL load-order hijacking. The backdoor hooks Windows APIs to prevent the victim from seeing the TeamViewer application. By default, MINEBRIDGE conducts command and control (C2) communication via HTTPS POST requests to hard-coded C2 domains. The POST requests contain a GUID derived from the system’s volume serial number, a TeamViewer unique id and password, username, computer name, operating system version, and beacon interval. MINEBRIDGE can also communicate with a C2 server by sending TeamViewer chat messages using a custom window procedure hook. Collectively, the two C2 methods support commands for downloading and executing payloads, downloading arbitrary files, self-deletion and updating, process listing, shutting down and rebooting the system, executing arbitrary shell commands, process elevation, turning on/off TeamViewer's microphone, and gathering system UAC information.\n\nMINEBRIDGE’s default method of communication is sending HTTPS POST requests over TCP port 443. This method of communication is always active; however, the beacon-interval time may be changed via a command. Before sending any C2 beacons, the sample waits to collect the TeamViewer generated unique id (<tv_id>) and password (<tv_pass>) via SetWindowsTextW hooks.",

Additionally, a specific loader is often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nWhile the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with 'CosmicDuke' and 'PinchDuke'. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nTwo details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly during the ‘old days‘ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C&C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&C server responds) is a feature also found in 'OnionDuke', 'CozyDuke', and 'HammerDuke'.",

The malware, named after its distinctive package name com.mm.user, can capture user input and screen content, and can also remotely control victim devices through various techniques, enabling its operators to carry out bank fraud on the victim’s device.\n\nFurthermore, MMRat uses a special customized command-and-control (C&C) protocol based on protocol buffers (aka Protobuf), an open-source data format used for serializing structured data. This feature, which is rarely seen in Android banking trojans, enhances its performance during the transfer of large volumes of data.",

All C2 communications are encrypted with the AES algorithm using a key generated by computing five MD5 hashes starting with the key “1qazxcvbnm”, and adding a salt value of “.)1/” in each iteration.\n\nThe C2 server will respond to requests from MobileOrder with commands that the Trojan refers to as “orders”. MobileOrder contains a command handler with functionality that provides a fairly robust set of commands, as seen in Table 6. The first byte of data provided by the C2 server is order number, which is followed by the encrypted data that needed to carry out the specific order.",

One of them – named GetMicInfo – contains an algorithm designed to gather database passwords by decrypting them from Windows registry values. This shows that the backdoor’s authors have deep knowledge of the targeted software and opted for this sophisticated method instead of collecting the data via a simpler yet “louder” approach, such as keylogging.\nExfiltrated credentials allow ModPipe’s operators access to database contents, including various definitions and configuration, status tables and information about POS transactions.",

Each component of this modular program performs a certain action: searches for payment orders and modifies them, replaces original payment details with fraudulent ones, and then erases traces. The success of replacement is due to the fact that at this stage the payment order has not yet been signed, which will occur after payment details are replaced. In addition to hiding the tracks, the concealment module again substitutes the fraudulent payment details in a debit advice after the transaction back with the original ones. This means that the payment order is sent and accepted for execution with the fraudulent payment details, and the responses come as if the payment details were the initial ones. This gives cybercriminals extra time to mule funds before the theft is detected.",

Although now well past its heyday, MyDoom continues to be a presence in the cyber threat landscape.\n\nWhile not as prominent as other malware families, MyDoom has remained relatively consistent during the past few years, averaging approximately 1.1 percent of all emails we see with malware attachments. We continue to record tens of thousands of MyDoom samples every month. The vast majority of MyDoom emails come from IP addresses registered in China, with the United States running a distant second. These emails are sent to recipients across the world, mostly targeting high tech, wholesale, retail, healthcare, education, and manufacturing industries.",

Looking at the bot commands, we first thought that LokiBot had been improved. However, we quickly realized that there is more going on: the name of the bot and the name of the panel changed to 'MysteryBot', even the network communication changed.\n\nDuring investigation of its network activity we found out that MysteryBot and LokiBot Android banker are both running on the same C&C server. This quickly brought us to an early conclusion that this newly discovered Malware is either an update to Lokibot, either another banking trojan developed by the same actor.",

One of the reasons for the file size is that it’s statically compiled with the OpenSSL library and contains unused code and data belonging to that library. But the main reason for its size is the presence of two very large functions that do nothing but waste processor clock cycles. These functions also “use” randomly generated strings that are also present in a binary.",

      "description": "(Trend Micro) NeoPocket is an information-stealing malware that targets ATMs manufactured by Diebold. S21sec discovered NeoPocket in April 2014. Unlike the majority of ATM malware, NeoPocket does not steal cash from the ATM as it focuses on data theft only. The malware steals ATM transaction data using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and keylogs user input from specific application windows. This stolen data can be sold in deep web markets for use in creating counterfeit payment cards and carrying out fraudulent fund transfers out of victims’ accounts. Because no cash is stolen from the ATM, the compromise tends to remain undetected for prolonged periods and thus allows the criminal group behind NeoPocket to collect large amounts of sensitive data.",

The payload attempts to detect the number of processor cores in the running environment, by calling the 'GetSystemInfo' API, which returns a structure with system data, including number of cores. If only one core is detected, it quits. This probably is an attempt to detect virtualized environments such as sandboxes, as well as other analysis environments used by reverse engineers, which often tend to be configured with a single core. If the CPU core check detects more than one core, it implants the 'NewCT2' RAT in %temp%\\MSSoap.DLL(some variants will use BurnDCSrv.DLL and IntelAMTPP.DLL) and executes the written file.",

The backdoor communicates with its C&C server via UDP or the Google Drive API. The Nightdoor implant from this campaign used the latter. It encrypts a Google API OAuth 2.0 token within the data section and uses the token to access the attacker’s Google Drive. We have requested that the Google account associated with this token be taken down.",

For example, Ninja has a feature like 'Cobalt Strike' pivot listeners, which can limit the number of direct connections from the targeted network to the remote C2 and control systems without internet access. It also provides the ability to control the HTTP indicators and camouflage malicious traffic in HTTP requests that appear legitimate by modifying HTTP header and URL paths.

It can also perform keylogger monitoring, remote desktop control, installing additional malicious software, and many other malicious activities on the victim’s computer. In addition, njRAT is still a malware family that is being actively distributed via various methods such as spear-phishing, malvertising, exploit kits and other techniques. Figure 1 shows a screenshot for the njRAT Panel Menu.\n\nDepending on the configuration taken from the attackers in njRAT panel, the features it provided can be used to perform malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data/information, disabling security software, install additional malicious payload to the victim’s computer and many more harmful actions. Upon the execution of njRAT, it will connect to the command and control (C&C) server, allowing the attacker to perform malicious activity on the victim’s machine.\n\nOther than that, it will create copies of itself in the %Temp% folder and rename itself by masquerading as a legitimate binary. In this example it was renamed to ‘svhost.exe’ which is trying to imitate ‘svchost.exe’. Furthermore, it tries to hide its persistence from the user by setting the file attributes as ‘Hidden’ onto the original and the copy of the binary.\n\nMoreover, it will also make a copy of itself in the “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu” folder and create or modify the registry key for persistence to ensure it will be executed on startup. The following event logs from CB Threat Hunter shown below display the relevant events.",

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).",

This variant of the Petya malware—referred to as NotPetya—encrypts files with extensions from a hard-coded list. Additionally, if the malware gains administrator rights, it encrypts the master boot record (MBR), making the infected Windows computers unusable. NotPetya differs from previous Petya malware primarily in its propagation methods.\n\nNotPetya leverages multiple propagation methods to spread within an infected network. According to malware analysis, NotPetya attempts the lateral movement techniques below:\n\n• 'PsExec' - a legitimate Windows administration tool\n• WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation, a legitimate Windows component\n• 'EternalBlue' - the same Windows SMBv1 exploit used by 'WannaCry'\n• 'EternalRomance' - another Windows SMBv1 exploit",

Sergey Polak demonstrated the technique at BlackHat back in 2004 at his session titled “Capturing Windows Passwords using the Network Provider API.” In 2020, researcher Grzegorz Tworek uploaded his tool NPPSpy to GitHub, which also implements this technique.\n\nDue to the file naming patterns of the DLL module, and as a reference to the previous research and tools, Unit 42 researchers named this malware family Ntospy. The threat actor registers the Ntospy DLL module as a Network Provider module to hijack the authentication process, to get access to the user credentials every time the victim attempts to authenticate to the system.",

We couldn´t find any legitimate software that this malware appears to be impersonating; in fact, we don´t believe it exists. The Trojan uses third-party Delphi libraries like The Indy Project for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower Abbrevia (sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia) for compression. Malware persistence is basic and achieved via the system registry. The server side uses commercial hosting in different countries with .php scripts deployed.",

The code is capable of logging GET and POST requests, grabbing full pages, terminating connections and injecting data into Web pages.\n\nAll logged requests and grabbed pages are sent to the C&C server in real time, allowing fraudsters to perform session hijacks — also in real time but hidden from the legitimate user of the online bank account. By tapping the session ID token, which banks use to identify a user’s online banking session, the fraudsters can electronically impersonate the legitimate user and complete a range of banking operations.",

From a technical perspective, the purpose of the malware is to deliver and start the wiper payload which attempts to destroy files on the remote network shares over the next 60 minutes. Meanwhile, the main module collects user passwords from browser and Windows storage and crafts a new generation of the worm that contains old and freshly collected compromised credentials. The new generation of the worm is pushed to accessible local network computers and starts using the PsExec tool, leveraging the collected credentials and current user privileges.\n\nOnce the wiper has run for 60 minutes it cleans Windows event logs, resets backups, deletes shadow copies from the file system, disables the recovery item in the Windows boot menu, disables all the services on the system and reboots the computer. Those files on the network shares that it managed to wipe within 60 minutes remain destroyed. The malware doesn’t use any persistence and even contains protection (also a killswitch) against recurring reinfection. Incidentally, only 1MB of the remote files are fully overwritten with zeroes; larger files were wiped with just 1K of zeroes in the header. The local files are not destroyed and the worm doesn’t wipe itself or its components.",

The Tor node would intercept any unencrypted executable files being downloaded and modify those executables by adding a malicious wrapper contained an embedded OnionDuke. Once the victim finished downloading the file and executed it, the wrapper would infect the victim’s computer with OnionDuke before executing the original legitimate executable.\n\nThe same wrapper has also been used to wrap legitimate executable files, which were then made available for users to download from torrent sites. Again, if a victim downloaded a torrent containing a wrapped executable, they would get infected with OnionDuke.\n\nFinally, we have also observed victims being infected with OnionDuke after they were already infected with 'CozyDuke'. In these cases, CozyDuke was instructed by its C&C server to download and execute OnionDuke toolset.",

The project is now closed, according to this “press release” issued, and a license-free version available for download, as well as software development tools and documentation. Interestingly, the author also claims there is a “kill switch” available for download by security researchers to remotely shut down and lock out any Orcus control server that they find are being used for malicious purposes.",

It mainly targets Microsoft Outlook, a widely used mail client, but also targets The Bat!, a mail client very popular in Eastern Europe.\nSecond, it uses email messages as a transport layer for its Command & Control (C&C) protocol. Data, such as files requested via a command of the backdoor, is exfiltrated in specially-crafted PDF documents attached to emails, and commands are also received in PDF attachments. Thus, its behavior is particularly stealthy. It is important to note that no vulnerabilities were used either in PDF readers nor in Outlook. What actually happens is that the malware is able to decode data from the PDF documents and interpret it as commands for the backdoor.",

We collected several samples of P8RAT during our research and found no C2 address of P8RAT that was used more than once. In total we found 10 backdoor commands in all the collected P8RAT samples. The most recent P8RAT sample, with the compilation timestamp of December 14, 2020, shows a new backdoor command with the code number of “309” implemented. The command “304”, which was present in earlier samples and carries similar functionality, was removed.",

Once the phone is exploited and Pegasus is installed, it begins contacting the operator’s command and control (C&C) servers to receive and execute operators’ commands, and send back the target’s private data, including passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages, and live voice calls from popular mobile messaging apps. The operator can even turn on the phone’s camera and microphone to capture activity in the phone’s vicinity.",

In addition to Vietnam, we have seen victims in the Philippines, but unfortunately we did not uncover the delivery mechanism in those cases.\nThis backdoor is quite simple and most of the malicious capabilities are likely deployed through additional plugins.

Although semantically similar, the PipeSnoop implant should not be considered an upgrade of 'HTTPSnoop'. Both implants are likely designed to work under different environments. The HTTP URLs used by HTTPSnoop along with the binding to the built-in Windows web server indicate that it was likely designed to work on internet-exposed web and EWS servers. PipeSnoop, however, as the name may imply, reads and writes to and from a Windows IPC pipe for its input/output (I/O) capabilities This suggests the implant is likely designed to function further within a compromised enterprise--instead of public-facing servers like HTTPSnoop — and probably is intended for use against endpoints the malware operators deem more valuable or high-priority. PipeSnoop is likely used in conjunction with another component that is capable of feeding it the required shellcode.",

It also takes pictures, captures screenshots, records audios, intercepts and sends SMS messages. In addition, it can log the keyboard input by the Android accessibility service, acting as a keylogger.\n\nPluginPhantom is a new class of Google Android Trojan: it is the first to use updating and to evade static detection. It does this by leveraging the Android plugin technology. It abuses the legitimate and popular open source framework “DroidPlugin”, which allows an app to dynamically launch any apps as plugins without installing them in the system. PluginPhantom implements each element of malicious functionality as a plugin, and utilizes a host app to control the plugins. With the new architecture, PluginPhantom achieves more flexibility to update its modules without reinstalling apps. PluginPhantom also gains the ability to evade the static detection by hiding malicious behaviors in plugins. Since the plugin development pattern is generic and the plugin SDK can be easily embedded, the plugin architecture could be a trend among Android malware in the future.",

PNGLoad is a loader that uses bytes from PNG files to create a payload to execute. It is a 64-bit .NET executable – obfuscated with .NET Reactor – that masquerades as legitimate software. For example, Figure 11 shows the CLR headers of a sample masquerading as a WinRAR DLL.",

The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called “Evil Eye” reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.",

The malware was installed using PowerShell, a popular Windows tool. With this tool the file (MD5: 0B4F921CF2537FCED9CAACA179F6DFF4) was executed, with an internal date of creation for two days before (28/09/2015 17:07:59) and compiled with C++ visuals.\n\nThe installer’s job is to infect the system with malware that is specifically designed for PoS systems. To do this, it uses different techniques in function with the PoS software installed on the system. In concrete, it looks for brain.exe (pertaining to Dinerware) and scpwin.exe processes, and installs the malware as follows depending on which of the two it finds.",

POSHSPY's use of WMI to both store and persist the backdoor code makes it nearly invisible to anyone not familiar with the intricacies of WMI. Its use of a PowerShell payload means that only legitimate system processes are utilized and that the malicious code execution can only be identified through enhanced logging or in memory. The backdoor's infrequent beaconing, traffic obfuscation, extensive encryption and use of geographically local, legitimate websites for command and control (C2) make identification of its network traffic difficult. Every aspect of POSHSPY is efficient and covert.\n\nMandiant initially identified an early variant of the POSHSPY backdoor deployed as PowerShell scripts during an incident response engagement in 2015. Later in that same engagement, the attacker updated the deployment of the backdoor to use WMI for storage and persistence. Mandiant has since identified POSHSPY in several other environments compromised by APT29 over the past two years.",

This creates the illusion of having clicked on a real document and ensures the victim doesn’t get suspicious.\n• Stage 1 is a PowerShell script containing C# assembly designed to connect to a dead drop resolver (more on this in the next paragraph) and obtain cryptographic material used to decode the last stage of the chain by extracting a “DLL” file from the shortcut and locating a Base64-encoded list of URLs at a fixed offset. This establishes persistence by creating a shortcut (using the dropped icon) in the Windows startup folder pointing to the VBE startup script.\n• Finally, on stage 2, the actual malware implant used to take control of the victim’s machine. It connects to one of the dead drop resolvers to get the address of the real C&C server and enters a loop that looks for orders every few seconds.\n• Upon system restart, the VBE startup script – which closely resembles stage 0 – is automatically executed, once again leading all the way to Powersing stage 2.\n\nCommunications with the C&C server involve the exchange of JSON-encoded objects. Powersing only has two tasks:\n\n• Capture periodic screenshots from the victim’s machine, which are immediately sent to the C&C server (two built-in commands allow operators to change screenshot quality and periodicity)\n• Execute arbitrary Powershell scripts provided by the C&C",

That’s how the crooks obtained the card data. Basically, when you pay at a local shop whose POS terminal is infected, your card data is transferred right away to the criminals.\n\nHowever, having the card data is just half the battle; to steal money, they also needed to be able to clone cards, a process made more complicated by the chips and their multiple authentications.\n\nThe Prilex group developed a whole infrastructure that lets its “customers” create cloned cards — which in theory shouldn’t be possible.",

While this malware shares some commonalities with that family, it departs from the standard operating procedure of the previous versions rather dramatically. In a blog post, TrendMicro also detailed recently compiled versions of the NewPOSthings family that bear a closer resemblance to NewPOSthings than Punkey. This suggests that multiple actors may be using similar source code, or the malware is being customized as a service for targeted campaigns.",

Although we have not found any shared code with any other known malware, the samples have intersections of coding patterns, style and techniques that have been seen in various Lambert families. We therefore named this malware Purple Lambert. Purple Lambert is composed of several modules, with its network module passively listening for a magic packet. It is capable of providing an attacker with basic information about the infected system and executing a received payload. Its functionality reminds us of 'Gray Lambert', another user-mode passive listener. Gray Lambert turned out to be a replacement of the kernel-mode passive-listener 'White Lambert' implant in multiple incidents. In addition, Purple Lambert implements functionality similar to, but in different ways, both Gray Lambert and White Lambert.",

Win32/Qadars uses a wide variety of webinjects, some with Android mobile components, used to bypass online banking security and to gain access to user’s bank account. Usually, banking Trojans either target a broad array of financial institutions or focus on a much smaller subset, usually institutions of which the user base is geographically close.

Orders come in the form of two-letter codes (e.g.: “xe” to list drives) which tend to vary between samples. As of today, this family is still in active development, and we have observed code refactoring as well as incremental upgrades over 2020.

The Qt framework is a platform for developing cross-platform applications. However, it is immensely popular for developing Graphical User Interface in applications. Although QuiteRAT, just like MagicRAT, uses embedded Qt libraries, none of these implants have a Graphical User Interface. .As seen with Lazarus Group’s MagicRAT malware, the use of Qt increases the code complexity, making human analysis harder. Using Qt also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable, since Qt is rarely used in malware development.\n\nBased on QuiteRAT’s technical characteristics, including the usage of the Qt framework, we assess that this implant belongs to the previously disclosed MagicRAT family. QuiteRAT was briefly discussed in WithSecure’s report from early 2023. The new campaign we’re disclosing exploited a ManageEngine ServiceDesk vulnerability (CVE-2022-47966) — which has a Kenna risk score of 100 out of 100 — to deploy QuiteRAT.",

Like all ransomware, the goal of this malware is to encrypt all files that it can and request a ransom for decrypting them.\nRagnarLocker’s operators, as we have seen with other bad actors recently, threaten to publish the information they get from compromised machines if ransoms are not paid.\nAfter conducting reconnaissance, the ransomware operators enter the victim’s network and, in some pre-deployment stages, steal information before finally dropping the ransomware that will encrypt all files in the victim’s machines.\nThe most notable RagnarLocker attack to date saw this malware deployed in a large company where the malware operators then requested a ransom of close to $11 million USD in return for not leaking information stolen from the company. In this report we will talk about the sample used in this attack.",

While they may not make much sense to a reverse engineer, it gives some idea to the information that the author doesn’t want to be easily recovered.

HackingTeam is an Italian software company that created RCS, which they describe as “the hacking suite for governmental interception”. In July 2015, news emerged that HackingTeam had been breached. One of the consequences of this incident was the then latest version of RCS Galileo being leaked to the public.\n\nAs a result of the leak, both the source code and the ready-made installers for the RCS platform were made available for anyone to use. Based on our analysis of Callisto Group’s usage of RCS Galileo, we believe the Callisto Group did not utilize the leaked RCS Galileo source code, but rather used the leaked ready-made installers to set up their own installation of the RCS Galileo platform. The process for using the leaked installers to set up an RCS Galileo installation has been described online in publicly available blogposts, making the process trivial to achieve.",

The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.\n\nClients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile), Linux, Unix, macOS, iOS, Android, and other operating systems. RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists. By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.",

The most noteworthy feature of Remsec’s tactics is the deliberate avoidance of patterns: Remsec customizes its implants and infrastructure for each individual target, and never reuses them. This approach, coupled with multiple routes for the exfiltration of stolen data, such as legitimate email channels and DNS, enables Remsec to conduct secretive, long-term spying campaigns in target networks.\n\nRemsec gives the impression of being an experienced and traditional actor that has put considerable effort into learning from other extremely advanced actors, including 'Duqu', 'Flame', Equation and 'Regin'; adopting some of their most innovative techniques and improving on their tactics in order to remain undiscovered.",

      "description": "(GovCERT.ch) Recently, some anti-virus companies and newspapers reported that Retefe is distributing the Signal App (a secure messenger). Rumours say that the threat actor may use the Signal App as a communication channel with the victim. This is not the case. As a matter of fact, the Signal App is just decoy that the Retefe Gang serves to IP addresses who are not geo located in Switzerland and whose user agent does not correspond to an Android device. If the accessing IP address uses an Android user agent and is geographically located in Switzerland, the APK server will serve an Android trojan that the Retefe gang use to commit e-banking fraud.\n\nThe trojan is an SMS stealer which allows the threat actor to steal text messages sent by the bank to the customer for two factor authentication (2FA) and transaction signing (so called mobile TAN or mTAN). To have the victim install the android trojan, the Retefe gang uses social engineering to convince the victim to either enter his mobile phone number where he then receives an SMS from the threat actor with a link to the Android APK, or to scan a QR code displayed by the threat actor in the fake e-banking portal, which also leads to the Android APK. But the Android trojan is more than just an SMS stealer. It is also able to send text messages to other victim’s and uses a sophisticated anti VM detection technique. Unlike Retefe itself, which doesn’t have any botnet C&C channel, the SMS stealer has such one. It uses two hard coded botnet C&Cs which are usually hosted on compromised websites.",

The similarities between the PowerShell and C# variants of RogueRobin suggests that the DarkHydrus group ported their code to a compiled variant.\n\nThe C# variant of RogueRobin attempts to detect if it is executing in a sandbox environment using the same commands as in the PowerShell variant of RogueRobin. The series of commands, as seen in Table 2, include checks for virtualized environments, low memory, and processor counts, in addition to checks for common analysis tools running on the system. The Trojan also checks to see if a debugger is attached to its processes and will exit if it detects the presence of a debugger.",

At a minimum, each family that is built upon R-C1 must provide an interface to their specific communications abstraction and a method by which to activate the R-C1 functionality.\n\nThe general flow of execution for families that use R-C1 is as follows:\n1. Dynamically load API functions\n2. Perform any configuration management tasks that the family may require (e.g., loading the configuration, opening listening ports, establishing persistence)\n3. Establish a communication channel with controlling endpoint\n4. Pass off the channel to the R-C1 component\n\nThere are five known families that are based on, or that incorporate, R-C1 (Figure 2-1): 'RomeoAlfa', 'RomeoBravo', 'RomeoCharlie', 'RomeoHotel', and 'RomeoNovember'. In addition to the four families having commonality through the use of R-C1, two of the families, 'RomeoAlfa' and 'RomeoHotel', share the distinctive fake TLS communication scheme and use the Caracachs encryption scheme as their underlying communication encryption. 'RomeoBravo', 'RomeoCharlie', and 'RomeoNovember' use DNSCALC-style encoding for communication encryption.",

There are two observed variants, RomeoCharlie-One and RomeoCharlie-Two.

RomeoCharlie is a server-mode RAT and, as such, must establish a listening port. Before a listening port is established at the Winsock level, RomeoCharlie first opens a hole in the Windows Firewall to allow incoming connections on the desired listening port (as specified in the configuration). The task of opening a firewall port consists of constructing and then issuing the command line.",

Like RomeoBravo, RomeoNovember uses DNSCALC-style encoding to obfuscate network communication instead of RomeoAlfa’s reliance on fake TLS. The similarity to RomeoBravo also extends to the use of the same base command number (0x523B) and channel ID (0x3456). The commands within R-C1 supported by RomeoNovember are the nearly the same as those supported by RomeoBravo, to the extent that RomeoNovember and RomeoBravo both implement the Secure Delete command with the same code. Only the Upload Directory as Archive command is missing from RomeoNovember.\n\nRomeoNovember’s hybrid nature may indicate an active development period for the developer(s).",

      "description": "(Novetta) In terms of sophistication and functionality, RomeoWhiskey is a mid-tier RAT. At its core, RomeoWhiskey provides the basic functionality one would expect in a RAT: file transfer commands, program execution, basic intelligence gathering, etcetera. Observed as early as May 2011, RomeoWhiskey, also known as Winsec, is one of the older family members used by the Lazarus Group, and, over the course of its lifetime, it has undergone at least one major revision. The first variant of RomeoWhiskey, RomeoWhiskey–One, has been observed with compile dates from May 2011 to late January/early February 2012, while RomeoWhiskey-Two, the second variant, was compiled from late February 2012 until at least March 2014.\n\nRomeoWhiskey uses numerical constants to identify specific commands, reflective of the way RATs like the Romeo-CoreOne-based families (see Section 2) identify commands by unique numerical constants. There are two sets of constants for identifying commands within the RomeoWhiskey samples that do not necessarily align with variant boundaries: command base 0x7D50 and command base 0x1E10.",

While other POS malware families are perfectly capable of sending captured Track1 and Track2 data to a C2 server, RtPOS merely saves the data locally. As this activity is similar to some POS utilities, this is likely intended to reduce the network activity footprint of RtPOS and ensure the malware remains undetected for longer, thus earning the controllers a healthier profit. The RtPOS malware is also simplistic in features, largely automated in operation, and lacks many of the features that more mature POS malware families do.\n\nThe lack of a network exfiltration feature, interaction and user commands, as well as a dropper component hints at more serious implications: in order for RtPOS to execute and in order to retrieve the captured payment card data, the attackers would have existing access to the victim’s machine(s). RtPOS may simply be an in-development POS malware family, though review and analysis suggests RtPOS is a post-compromise tool instead of a standalone malware, and may even be part of a larger, heretofore unidentified tool set.",

The attacker has opened an SSH tunneling to another port in order to maintain an encrypted RDP on the attacked target.\n\nMoreover, like with the backdoor that had hardcoded and predefined credentials, here too the attacker separated every server that was opened to the outside world.",

Its intended usage as a tool for collecting system information and automation makes it an ideal mechanism for gathering and exfiltrating data. The use of legitimate Windows features can make it more difficult for administrators to identify activity as malicious.\n\nShadowNet typically uses multi-layered C2 infrastructure that first connects to blog websites and then retrieves C2 information from encoded strings left on the blog. By using blog sites as intermediaries the attackers can maintain control of compromised machines even if a C2 is blocked by a network firewall or otherwise goes down. If a C2 needs to be updated the attackers can simply point the intermediaries to new servers.",

This makes the traffic look like it comes from a real user visiting a blog with a regular web browser. In fact, the page is not being displayed at all on the infected system; the Trojan just decodes the information within the comments and is able to understand the commands the attacker is sending. On a cursory look to the actual blog, a visitor would never spot any of this, since the comments are never displayed on the browser either.\n\nThis is a perfect vehicle for these attackers, who are trying to stay undetected for as long as possible. ShadyRAT was the first major targeted attack that was spotted in the wild, and this technique was possibly a contributing factor. The network traffic looks perfectly tame to any traffic observer or security device.\n\nOn top of this, ShadyRAT was also able to decrypt and decode C&C commands hidden within JPG files using the LSB technique as seen in the first entry of this series. A shady one indeed.",

Since the lack of information and the absence of a proper nomenclature of this malware family, we decided to dub it SharkBot to better track this family inside our internal Threat Intelligence taxonomy.\n\nSharkBot belongs to a “new” generation of mobile malware, as it is able to perform ATS attacks inside the infected device. This technique has been already seen recently from other banking trojans, such as Gustuff. ATS (Automatic Transfer System) is an advanced attack technique (fairly new on Android) which enables attackers to auto-fill fields in legitimate mobile banking apps and initiate money transfers from the compromised devices. Contrary to TeaBot and Oscorp/UBEL where a live operator is required to insert and authorize a money transfer, with ATS technique Threat Actors can scale up their operations with minimum user intervention. We assume that SharkBot is trying to bypass behavioural detection countermeasures (e.g.,biometrics) put in place by multiple banks and financial services with the abuse of Android Accessibility Services, also bypassing the need of a “new device enrollment”.",

Analysis indicates the primary purpose of this application is to destroy a compromised Windows system by overwriting and deleting the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the victim's system and deleting files on network mapped shares as well as physically attached storage devices.\n\nThe malware must be executed from a command line using any alphanumeric character or string as an argument. Once executed, themalware first attempts to disable the 'System Event Notification' and 'Alerter' services.\n\nNote: The Alerter service is present in Windows XP and Windows 2003, which are no longer supported by Microsoft.  Current operating systems supported by Microsoft do not run the Alerter service.\n\nNext, the malware overwrites the MBR, displaying a status in the command (CMD) window.  If the malware is able to overwrite the MBR, an 'OK' status is displayed in the CMD window. If the malware is unable to overwrite the MBR, a 'Fail' status is displayed.\n\nAfter the MBR is overwritten, the malware attempts to gain access to physical and network drives attached to the victim's system and recursively enumerate through the drive’s contents. When the malware identifies a file, it overwrites the file's contents with NULL bytes, renames the file with a randomly generated file name, then deletes the file, making forensic recovery impossible.\n\nIf the malware is able to overwrite, rename and delete the file, the CMD window will display a 'Break>' status.  If the malware is only able to delete the file, the CMD window will display a 'Del>' status.\n\nOnce the malware has completed deleting files, the system is rebooted. If the malware has executed successfully, the system is rendered inoperative.",

By studying the ShellClient development cycles, the researchers were able to observe how ShellClient has morphed over time from a rather simple reverse shell to a sophisticated RAT used to facilitate cyber espionage operations while remaining undetected.\n\nThe most recent ShellClient versions observed in Operation GhostShell follow the trend of abusing cloud-based storage services, in this case the popular Dropbox service. The ShellClient authors chose to abandon their previous C2 domain and replace the command and control mechanism of the malware with a more simple yet more stealthy C2 channel using Dropbox to exfiltrate the stolen data as well as to send commands to the malware. This trend has been increasingly adopted by many threat actors due to its simplicity and the ability to effectively blend in with legitimate network traffic.",

However, a more in-depth analysis revealed that the d3d11.dll sample implanted a skeleton key, where adversaries could persistently control (before the system reboot) the infected machine and machines under the infected AD. More specifically, the malware was an account manipulation tool that contained code extracted from both Dumpert and 'Mimikatz'. We called this malware SkeletonKeyInjector. The malware employed a technique that altered the NTLM authentication program and implanted a skeleton key to allow adversaries to log-in without a valid credential. This allowed the adversary to achieve the following objectives:\n● Persistence: After the code in memory was altered, the adversary could gain access to the compromised machines before the next system reboot. As AD machines are rarely rebooted, the adversary was able to control the machines for a very long time.\n● Defense Evasion: Aside from the different login password and login algorithm scheme, there was no difference when compared to a normal login activity. Furthermore, normal users could still log-in to the system via their original password. Thus, the probability of being exposed was low.\n● Lateral Movement: Adversaries could use the skeleton key to login to other machines that were in the same domain. This made it easier for an adversary to conduct lateral movement.",

      "description": "(Kaspersky) While analysing an incident which involved a suspected keylogger, we identified a malicious library able to interact with a virtual file system, which is usually the sign of an advanced APT actor. This turned out to be a malicious loader internally named ‘Slingshot’, part of a new, and highly sophisticated attack platform that rivals Project Sauron and 'Regin' in complexity.\n\nThe initial loader replaces the victim´s legitimate Windows library ‘scesrv.dll’ with a malicious one of exactly the same size. Not only that, it interacts with several other modules including a ring-0 loader, kernel-mode network sniffer, own base-independent packer, and virtual filesystem, among others.\n\nFollowing infection, Slingshot would load a number of modules onto the victim device, including two huge and powerful ones: 'Cahnadr', the kernel mode module, and 'GollumApp', a user mode module. The two modules are connected and able to support each other in information gathering, persistence and data exfiltration.",

For starters, we discovered it being spread via watering hole attacks, a technique that involves an attacker compromising a website before adding code to it so visitors are redirected to the infecting code. In this case, each visitor is redirected only once. The infection was done by exploiting CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft back in May 2018.\nSecond, it uses a multi-stage infection scheme. After it exploits the vulnerability, it downloads a DLL and runs it in PowerShell (PS). This file, which is a downloader, then downloads and runs the second executable file containing a backdoor. The first stage downloader also checks for the existence of different kinds of antivirus software processes, and then proceeds to exit if any is found. At the time of discovery, the backdoor was seemingly unknown to AV products.",

After some quick initialization, the backdoor XORs an embedded string with 0x9D to extract the IP address of the C&C server. Subsequently it establishes a connection to it (generally on port 80) and checks in with some basic information about the system.\n\nAfter the check-in message is sent, the malware enters a continuous loop in which it will keep silently waiting for commands from the open socket connection. From now on, it expects some manual interaction from the attacker.\n\nThe supported commands are:\n• shell\n• comd\n• sleep\n• quit\n• kill",

We are calling this variant of the backdoor Snugy, as 'Netero' is already a name of a variant of the 'Hisoka' tool used by the xHunt actors.",

While we found the native code that is bundled up in the app is somewhat obfuscated, the latest binary served up by attacker infrastructure was not, and contains new code to target Facebook and Google Hangouts. These improvements in capability suggest that the actor behind SpyWaller may be deploying it in campaigns outside of China, where we believe the majority of previous activity to have been conducted.",

The adversary added a malicious version of the binary solarwinds.orion.core.businesslayer.dll into the SolarWinds software lifecycle, which was then signed by the legitimate SolarWinds code signing certificate. This binary, once installed, calls out to a victim-specific avsvmcloud[.]com domain using a protocol designed to mimic legitimate SolarWinds protocol traffic. After the initial check-in, the adversary can use the Domain Name System (DNS) response to selectively send back new domains or IP addresses for interactive command and control (C2) traffic. Consequently, entities that observe traffic from their SolarWinds Orion devices to avsvmcloud[.]com should not immediately conclude that the adversary leveraged the SolarWinds Orion backdoor. Instead, additional investigation is needed into whether the SolarWinds Orion device engaged in further unexplained communications. If additional Canonical Name record (CNAME) resolutions associated with the avsvmcloud[.]com domain are observed, possible additional adversary action leveraging the backdoor has occurred.",

In October 2019, a new ransomware was found in-the-wild (5657abdb9d99cd5aec433099f8d6f53d). The new ransomware was written in Go and targeted Windows machines. This version of SunCrypt was not reported in many attacks and it wasn’t until mid-2020 when a new version of the ransomware written in C/C++ was discovered, that attacks started to increase. It is an interesting shift of retooling from Go to C/C++ when other groups are instead retooling from C/C++ to Go.\n\nWhile the RaaS didn’t appear until October 2019, these ransomware share connections with another ransomware, called QNAPCrypt (also known as eCh0raix), that was used to target Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices back in July 2019. Both families share identical code logic for the file encryption, which we can conclude with high certainty has been compiled from the same source code.",

Usually, these are done via HTTP or other TCP/IP connections. However, we recently encountered a botnet that uses a more unusual method: an FTP server that, in effect, acts as a C&C server.\n\nUsing an FTP server has some advantages. It is less common, and this fact may allow it to slip unnoticed by administrators and researchers. However, this also leaves the C&C traffic open for monitoring by others, including security researchers. In addition, thanks to a coding mistake by the attackers, this particular backdoor does not always run the right commands.",

It acts both as a network proxy for  concealed communications and as a remote administration tool (RAT)—capable of executing Windows commands, and delivering and executing scripts, malicious executables and dynamic link libraries (DLLs).  After being dropped by other malware, it provides attackers with a persistent backdoor.\n\nWhile SystemBC has been around for over a year, we’ve seen both its use and its features continue to evolve. The most recent samples of SystemBC carry code that, instead of acting essentially as a virtual private network via a SOCKS5 proxy, uses the Tor anonymizing network to encrypt and conceal the destination of command and control traffic.",

We named this backdoor SysJoker.\n\nSysJoker was first discovered during an active attack on a Linux-based web server of a leading educational institution. After further investigation, we found that SysJoker also has Mach-O and Windows PE versions. Based on Command and Control (C2) domain registration and samples found in VirusTotal, we estimate that the SysJoker attack was initiated during the second half of 2021.\n\nSysJoker masquerades as a system update and generates its C2 by decoding a string retrieved from a text file hosted on Google Drive. During our analysis the C2 changed three times, indicating the attacker is active and monitoring for infected machines. Based on victimology and malware’s behavior, we assess that SysJoker is after specific targets.",

The capability of TARSIP backdoors includes file uploading, file downloading, interactive command shells, process enumeration, process creation, process termination. The TARSIP-ECLIPSE family is distinguished by the presence of 'eclipse' in .pdb debug strings present in the malware samples. It does not provide a built in mechanism to maintain persistence. The TARSIP-MOON family is distinguished by the presence of 'moon' in .pdb debug strings present in the malware samples.  It does not provide a built in mechanism to maintain persistence.",

Upon execution, it will first brute force its own decryption key (a 32-bit value, meaning this takes a fraction of second on modern PCs) before using this to decrypt the main program code.\n\nCode-wise the POS component is very similar to the loader, except there is no additional encryption, as whenever it is delivered the operators are almost certain -due to the pre-filtering above- that a valuable target has been identified.\nThis component works like any other POS memory scraper: opening processes based on either a predefined black or whitelist of process names, creating a new thread for each matching one and scanning their full memory range for Track 1 and Track 2 credit card data. If such data is found, first it will be verified by the Luhn algorithm for integrity, then it will be encrypted by a pre-defined key (another 32 or 64-bit value stored in the POS binary itself) and either sent to yet another C2 identified, again, by IP/port combination or it will be saved locally.",

One of the key features of Tinyproxy is the buffering connection concept. In effect, Tinyproxy will buffer a high speed response from a server, and then relay it to a client at the highest speed the client will accept. This feature greatly reduces the problems with sluggishness on the Internet. If you are sharing an Internet connection with a small network, and you only want to allow HTTP requests to be allowed, then Tinyproxy is a great tool for the network administrator.",

This sophisticated campaign employs a trojan that follows a multi-staged infection chain, utilizing specially crafted modules throughout each stage. These modules are custom designed to carry out malicious activities, such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing User Account Control via COM Elevation Moniker, and evading detection by Sandboxes through clever techniques like system reboots and parent process checks. The ultimate payload of this campaign is a new Latin American Trojan called TOITOIN, which incorporates a unique XOR decryption technique to decode its configuration file. Once decrypted, the trojan gathers crucial system information, as well as data pertaining to installed browsers and the Topaz OFD Protection Module, before sending it to the command and control server of the attackers in an encoded format.",

It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again. In case no reboot occurs, the implant uninstalls itself after 30 days, unless this period is extended by the attackers.",

Its authors also show an ability for constant new features and developments.\n\nTrojan.TrickBot comes in modules accompanied by a configuration file. Each module has a specific task like gaining persistence, propagation, stealing credentials, encryption, and so on. The C&Cs are set up on hacked wireless routers.",

However, only some of these capabilities were leveraged in the trilog.exe sample (e.g. the attacker did not leverage all of TRITON’s extensive reconnaissance capabilities).\n\nThe TRITON malware contained the capability to communicate with Triconex SIS controllers (e.g. send specific commands such as halt or read its memory content) and remotely reprogram them with an attacker-defined payload. The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception. If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks.",

The code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with the loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server.\n\nThe secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is embedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor wants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that will be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. Commands supported by the payload are execution of programs, up-, download and deletion of files and capability to manipulate MAC timestamps.",

If the link file becomes corrupted, the updater.mod module restores it.\n\nIn this campaign the C2 servers were mostly based on cloud storage at mydrive.ch. For every victim, the operators created a new account there and uploaded additional malware modules and a configuration file with commands to execute it. Once executed, the updater.mod module connected to the C2 and performed the following actions:\n• downloaded the command file to the working directory;\n• uploaded files collected and prepared by additional malicious modules (if any) to the C2. These files were located in a directory called ‘queue’ or ‘ntfsrecover’ in the working directory. Files in this directory could have one of two extensions: .d or .upd depending on whether they had already been uploaded to the server or not.\n• downloaded additional malware modules:\no 'dfrgntfs5.sqt' – a module for executing commands from the C2;\no 'msvcrt58.sqt' – a module for stealing mail credentials and emails;\no 'zl4vq.sqt' – legitimate zlib library used by dfrgntfs5;\no %victim_ID%.upe – optional plug-in for dfrgntfs5.

Moreover, this function copies certain files into the USB %RECYCLER% folder, monitors files’ modified time, and updates the newest one to the USB device. The last function will infiltrate the target’s internal machine with a customized Windows command and reverse backdoor malware.",

Though it was first observed in late 2019, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has investigated a series of dramatic changes, an evolution of over 30 different versions in less than six months. This research shows that Valak is more than just a loader for other malware, and can also be used independently as an information stealer to target individuals and enterprises.\nTargeting Enterprises: More recent versions of Valak target Microsoft Exchange servers to steal enterprise mailing information and passwords along with the enterprise certificate. This has the potential to access critical enterprise accounts, causing damage to organizations, brand degradation, and ultimately a loss of consumer trust.\nTargets US and Germany: This campaign is specifically targeting enterprises in the US and Germany.\nWith a Rich Modular Architecture: Valak’s basic capabilities are extended with a number of plugin components for reconnaissance and information stealing.\nUsing Fast Development Cycles: Valak has evolved from a loader to a sophisticated, multi-stage modular malware that collects plugins from its C2 server to expand its capabilities. The Cybereason Nocturnus team has observed over 30 different versions in about 6 months.\nDesigned for Stealth: Valak is a stealthy malware that uses advanced evasive techniques like ADS and hiding components in the registry. In addition, over time the developers of Valak chose to abandon using PowerShell, which can be detected and prevented by modern security products.",

The program also stops processes that could be locking important files, such as Microsoft Exchange and SQL Server. Files are encrypted with a combination of AES-256 in ECB mode and RSA-2048. In our initial report published at the time we noted two peculiarities with this program’s implementation:\n• The ransomware uses Mersenne Twister as a source of randomness, but unfortunately for the victims the RNG is reseeded every time new data is consumed. Still, this is unorthodox cryptography, as is the decision to use the “electronic codebook” (ECB) mode for the AES algorithm. The combination of ECB and AES is not semantically secure, which means the patterns of the original clear data are preserved upon encryption. This was reiterated by cybersecurity researchers who analyzed Zoom security in April 2020.\n• VHD implements a mechanism to resume operations if the encryption process is interrupted. For files larger than 16MB, the ransomware stores the current cryptographic materials on the hard drive, in clear text. This information is not deleted securely afterwards, which implies there may be a chance to recover some of the files.",

Therefore, it is possible that additional HIDDEN COBRA malware may be present on network infrastructure compromised with Volgmer.\n\nAs a backdoor Trojan, Volgmer has several capabilities including: gathering system information, updating service registry keys, downloading and uploading files, executing commands, terminating processes, and listing directories. In one of the samples received for analysis, the US-CERT Code Analysis Team observed botnet controller functionality.",

It also contains the hard disk identification code found at www.winsim.com/diskid32/diskid32.cpp.  When the WARP executing remote commands, the malware creates a copy of the ?%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\cmd.exe? file as '%USERPROFILE%\\Temp\\~ISUN32.EXE'.  The version signature information of the duplicate executable is zeroed out.  Some WARP variants maintain persistence through the use of DLL search order hijacking.",

The ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an abbreviation of the victim’s name and the string ‘wasted’. The abbreviation of the victim’s name was also seen in 'BitPaymer', although a larger portion of the organisation name was used in BitPaymer and individual letters were sometimes replaced by similar looking numbers.\n\nTechnically, WastedLocker does not have much in common with BitPaymer, apart from the fact that it appears that victim specific elements are added using a specific builder rather than at compile time, which is similar to BitPaymer. Some similarities were also noted in the ransom note generated by the two pieces of malware. The first WastedLocker example we found contained the victim name as in BitPaymer ransom notes and also included both a protonmail.com and tutanota.com email address. Later versions also contained other Protonmail and Tutanota email domains, as well as Eclipso and Airmail email addresses. Interestingly the user parts of the email addresses listed in the ransom messages are numeric (usually 5 digit numbers) which is similar to the 6 to 12 digit numbers seen used by BitPaymer in 2018.",

Each file provides a specific remote control feature and is downloaded from the attackers’ server every time the system starts up. These files are not saved on disk or in the registry but are loaded directly into the memory.\n\nAt the very start of the operation, after launching the driver, PlusDLL collects information about the infected system. A unique identifier for the infected computer is generated based on information about the hard drive and the network adapter’s MAC address, e.g., TKVFP-XZTTL-KXFWH-RBJLF-FXWJR. The attackers are interested primarily in the computer’s name, the program which loaded the malicious library, as well as information about remote desktop sessions (session name, client name, user name and session time). All of this data is collected in a buffer, which is then compressed and sent to the attackers’ control center.\n\nIn reply to this initial message from the bot, the control center sends the list of available plugins. Plugins are DLL libraries that provide specific remote control functions. Upon receiving the list of plugins, the bot downloads them, allocates them in the memory and passes control to these libraries.\n\nAlso see 'HighNoon', which seems to be a variant of Winnti.",

It is notable because it uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to establish persistence. VBS_WIMMIE registers a script that works as a backdoor to the WMI event handler and deletes files associated with it or TROJ_WIMMIE. As a result, the backdoor cannot be detected by antivirus software through simple file scanning.The compromised computer posts data to a PHP script that runs on the C&C server, usually count.php.\n\nThe initial communication results in the creation of a file on the C&C server that contains information on the compromised computer. Although the file is empty, the file name contains the hostname of the compromised computer, followed by its MAC address, along with the campaign code the attackers use to identify which malware attack caused the compromise:\n~[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]\n\nThe attacker then creates a file with a name that ends in @.c, which contains a command.\n[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@.c\n\nThe compromised computer then downloads the file and executes the specified command, which may include any of the following:\n• Get external IP address\n• Execute shell command\n• Download file\n• Upload file\n\nThe compromised computer then sends the output to the C&C server and deletes the command file.",

We named this malware 'WolfRAT' due to strong links between this malware (and the command and control (C2) infrastructure) and Wolf Research, an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by CSIS during Virus Bulletin 2018. We identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous Wolf Research work. The organization appears to be shut down, but the threat actors are still very active.\n\nWe identified campaigns targeting Thai users and their devices. Some of the C2 servers are located in Thailand. The panels also contain Thai JavaScript comments and the domain names also contain references to Thai food, a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these C2 panels without much disruption.",

In subsequent months, that size increased up to 1.6 MB.\nIn January 2017, with version 1.14.8.0, OpenSSL 1.0.2j was linked to it, increasing the size to 1.8 MB. Soon after also in January 2017, with version v1.15.0.0 the code was obfuscated, blowing up the size of the binary to 2.2 MB.\n\nPlease note that IBM X-Force decided to call win.zloader/win.zeus_openssl 'Zeus Sphinx', after mentioning it as 'a new version of Zeus Sphinx' in their initial post in August 2016. Malpedia thus lists the alias 'Zeus XSphinx' for win.zeus_openssl - the X to refer to IBM X-Force.\n\nZeus Sphinx on the one hand has the following versioning ('slow increase')\n- 2015/09 v1.0.1.0 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n- 2016/02 v1.0.1.2 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n- 2016/04 v1.0.2.0 (Zeus Sphinx size: 1.5 MB)\n\nZeus OpenSSL on the other hand has the following versioning ('fast increase')\n- 2016/05 v1.5.4.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 1.2 MB)\n- 2017/01 v1.14.8.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 1.8 MB)\n- 2017/01 v1.15.0.0 (Zeus OpenSSL size: 2.2 MB)",

More recently, we have seen injects for online payment sites, casinos, retailers, and more appearing in banking Trojan campaigns.\n\nSince November -- a period of time that includes Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and now leading up to Christmas -- we have observed Zeus Panda banking Trojan campaigns that have an increasing focus on non-banking targets with an extensive list of injects clearly designed to capitalize on holiday shopping and activities.",

When ZIPLINE invokes the hijacked accept() function, it first resolves the benign accept() from libc, to intercept network traffic. Once an incoming connection is registered, it is first processed by the benign libc_accept, and ZIPLINE then checks if the process name is “web”. The malware retrieves up to 21 bytes from the connected host, verifying if the received buffer corresponds to the string “SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_0.3xx.”  If so, the malicious functionality of ZIPLINE is triggered. ZIPLINE will then receive an encrypted header which specifies the command to be executed. Further details about this hijacking technique for the accept() function can be found in this SecureIdeas post.",

It comes as no surprise that cybercriminals have created new and sophisticated pieces of mobile malware for Symbian and Windows Mobile; more surprising is that Blackberry devices were also targeted; and even more surprising is that until July 2011 there was no evidence of ZitMo for Android’s existence. And now please ‘welcome’ ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.\n\nThe first fact that must be mentioned is that ZitMo for Android differs from Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry versions a lot. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&C.\n\nThe functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive. The APK file itself has a 19k size. It passes itself off as a security tool from the ‘Trusteer’ company.",

Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot. These changes may be related to the Moskalvzapoe Distribution Network, which started the distribution of it at the same time.",
